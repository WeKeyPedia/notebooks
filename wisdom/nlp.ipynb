Love is essentially an [[abstraction|abstract]] concept, easier to experience than to explain. Because of the complex and abstract nature of love, discourse on love is commonly reduced to a [[thought-terminating cliché]], and there are a number of common [[proverb]]s regarding love, from Virgil's \"Love conquers all\" to [[The Beatles]]' \"[[All You Need is Love|All you need is love]]\".

Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. [[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] created his [[Triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: Intimacy, Commitment, and Passion. Intimacy is a form where two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives.  Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is simply sex, or passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. This led researchers such as Yela to further refine the model by separating Passion into two independents components: Erotic Passion and Romantic Passion.</div></td>\n",

Notably, there was also a significant positive correlation between levels of NGF and the intensity of romantic love as assessed with the passionate love scale (r=0.34; p=0.007). No differences in the concentrations of other NTs were detected. In 39 subjects in love who—after 12–24 months—maintained the same relationship but were no longer in the same mental state to which they had referred during the initial evaluation, plasma NGF levels decreased and became indistinguishable from those of the control groups.\"[http://www.healthnewsblog.com]</div></td>\n",

      "- '''Love''' is a profound [[feeling]] of tender [[affection]] for or intense [[interpersonal attraction|attraction]] to another. It is considered a deep, [[ineffability|ineffable]] feeling shared in passionate or [[intimacy|intimate]] [[interpersonal relationship]]s. However, in different contexts, the word ''love'' has a variety of related but distinct meanings: in addition to [[romantic love]], which is characterized by a mix of [[emotion]]al and [[human sexuality|sexual]] desire, other forms include [[platonic love]], [[love (religious views)|religious love]], [[familial love]], and the more casual application of the term to anyone or anything that one considers strongly pleasurable, enjoyable, or desirable, including activities and foods. This diverse range of meanings in a single word is commonly contrasted with the plurality of [[Greek words for love|Greek words for ''love'']], reflecting the word's versatility and complexity.\n",
      "- \n",
      "- Although clearly and consistently defining ''love'' is a difficult task, and often a subject of much debate, different aspects of the word can be clarified by determining what ''isn't'' \"love\". As a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of ''like''), love is commonly contrasted with [[hate]] (or neutral [[apathy]]); as a less sexual and more \"pure\" form of romantic attachment, love is commonly contrasted with [[lust]]; and as an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is commonly contrasted with [[friendship]], though other definitions of the word ''love'' may be applied to close friendships in certain contexts.\n",
      "- ==Overview==\n",
      "- [[Image:Love-zh.png|215px|thumb|left|The traditional [[Chinese character]] for love (愛) consists of a [[heart]] (middle) inside of \"accept\", \"feel\", or \"perceive\", which shows a graceful emotion.]]\n",
      "- \n",
      "- In ordinary use, ''love'' usually refers to interpersonal love, an experience felt by a person for another person. Love often involves caring for or identifying with a person or thing, including oneself (cf. [[narcissism]]).\n",
      "- \n",
      "- The concept of love, however, is subject to debate. Some deny the existence of love. Others call it a recently-invented abstraction, sometimes dating the \"invention\" to courtly Europe during or after the middle ages&mdash;though this is contradicted by the sizable body of \n",
      "- [http://www.TrueOpenLove.org/reference/AncientLovePoetry.html ancient love poetry]. Others maintain that love really exists, and is not an abstraction, but is undefinable, being a quantity which is [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] in nature. Some psychologists maintain that love is the action of lending one's \"boundary\" or \"[[self-esteem]]\" to another. Others attempt to define love by applying the definition to everyday life.\n",
      "- \n",
      "- Cultural differences make any universal definition of love difficult to establish. Expressions of love may include the love for a [[soul]] or [[mind]], the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, love for the respect of others, etc. Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an [[abstraction|abstract]] concept, easier to experience than to explain. Because of the complex and abstract nature of love, discourse on love is commonly reduced to a [[thought-terminating cliché]], and there are a number of common [[proverb]]s regarding love, from Virgil's \"Love conquers all\" to [[The Beatles]]' \"[[All You Need is Love|All you need is love]]\". [[Bertrand Russell]] describes love as a condition of \"absolute value\", as opposed to [[relative value]].\n",

      "- Throughout history, predominantly, [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] have speculated the most into the phenomenon of love. In the last century, the science of [[psychology]] has written a great deal on the subject. Recently, however, the sciences of [[evolutionary psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[anthropology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[biology]] have begun to take centre stage in discussion as to the nature and function of love.\n",
      "- \n",
      "- Biological models of sex tend to see it as a [[mammal]]ian drive, just like [[hunger]] or [[thirst]]. Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. [[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] created his [[Triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: Intimacy, Commitment, and Passion. Intimacy is a form where two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives.  Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is simply sex, or passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. This led researchers such as Yela to further refine the model by separating Passion into two independents components: Erotic Passion and Romantic Passion.\n",
      "- \n",
      "- ===Chemical Love===\n",
      "- Recent studies in [[neuroscience]] have indicated that a consistent number of chemicals are present in the brain when people testify to feeling love. These chemicals include; [[Testosterone]], [[Oestrogen]], [[Dopamine]], [[Norepinephrine]], [[Serotonin]], [[Oxytocin]], and [[Vasopressin]]. More specifically, higher levels of Testosterone and Oestrogen are present during the lustful phase of a relationship. Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and Seretonin are more commonly found during the attraction phase of a relationship. Oxytocin, and Vasopressin seemed to be more closely linked to long term bonding and relationships characterized by strong attachments.\n",
      "- \n",
      "- In [[December]] [[2005]], [[Italian]] [[scientists]] at [[Pavia University]] found that a [[molecule]] known as the [[Nerve Growth Factor]] has high levels when people first fall in love, but these levels return to as they were after one year.\n",
      "- \n",
      "- \"NGF level was significantly higher (p<0.001) in the subjects in love [mean (SEM): 227 (14) pg/ml] than in either the subjects with a long-lasting relationship [123 (10) pg/ml] or the subjects with no relationship [149 (12) pg/ml]. Notably, there was also a significant positive correlation between levels of NGF and the intensity of romantic love as assessed with the passionate love scale (r=0.34; p=0.007). No differences in the concentrations of other NTs were detected. In 39 subjects in love who—after 12–24 months—maintained the same relationship but were no longer in the same mental state to which they had referred during the initial evaluation, plasma NGF levels decreased and became indistinguishable from those of the control groups.\"[http://www.healthnewsblog.com]\n",

For example, in [[India]], with arranged marriages commonplace, it is believed that love is not a necessary ingredient in the initial stages of marriage – it is something that can be created during the marriage; whereas in Western culture, by comparison, love is seen as a necessary prerequisite to marriage.\n",

      "- \n",
      "- A third view, pantheism, recognises a state or truth distinct from (and often antagonistic to) the idea that there is a difference between the worshipping subject and the worshipped object. Love is reality, of which we, moving through time, imperfectly interprete ourselves as an isolated part.\n",
      "- \n",
      "- The [[Bible]] speaks of love as a set of attitudes and actions that are far broader than the concept of love as an emotional attachment.
