He came to be seen as a champion for the rights of those considered mentally ill.  He spoke out against (and wrote about) practices of psychiatrists which he considered inhumane or barbaric, such as electric shock treatment.  Like Wittgenstein, he was frequently concerned with clarifying the use of language in the field -- so, for example, he suggested that the effects of psychiatric drugs (some of which are very deleterious, such as tardive diskensia) be called just that: \"effects\", and not be referred to by the preferred euphemisms of the drug companies, who prefer to call them \"side effects\".
