[[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] observed that indiscriminate indulgence sometimes resulted in negative consequences. Some experiences should were therefore rejected out of hand, and some unpleasant experiences endured in the present to ensure a better life in the future. The ''summum bonum'', or greatest good, to Epicurus was prudence, exercised through moderation and caution. Excessive indulgence can be destructive to pleasure and can even lead to pain. For example, eating one food too often will cause a person to loose taste for it. Eating too much food at once will lead to discomfort and ill-health. Pain and fear were to be avoided. Living was essentially good, barring pain and illness. Death was not to be feared. Fear of death was considered the source of most unhappiness. Conquering the fear of death would naturally lead to a happier life. Epicurus reasoned if there was an afterlife and immortality, the fear of death was irrational. If there was no life after death, then the person would not be alive to suffer, fear or worry; he would be non-existent in death. It is irrational to fret over circumstances that do not exist, such as one's state in death in the absence of an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis.
