For example: \"Joe has good ethics.\"  It may also be used to characterize the questions of right-conduct in some specific sphere, even when such right-conduct is not examined philosophically: \"business ethics,\" or \"the ethics of child-rearing\" may refer, but need not refer, to a philosophical examination of such issues.
