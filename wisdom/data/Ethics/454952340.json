At birth, a baby is not a person, but a potential person. To become a \"real\" person, the child's inherent potential must be realized. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by the unrealized potential of a person, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Aristotle said, \"[[Nature]] does nothing in vain.\" Therefore, it is imperative for persons to act in accordance with their nature and develop their latent talents in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as [[civic duty|civic life]] or [[wealth]], are merely means to the end.
