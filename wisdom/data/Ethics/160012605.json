Meta-ethics as a discipline gained attention with [[G.E. Moore]]'s famous work ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' from 1903 in which Moore first addressed what he referred to as ''the [[naturalistic fallacy]]''. Moore's rebuttal of naturalistic ethics, his [[Open Question Argument]] sparked an interest within the analytic branch of western philosophy to concern oneself with second order questions about ethics; specifically the [[semantics]], [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] of ethics.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>The semantics of ethics divides naturally into descriptivism and non-descriptivism.
