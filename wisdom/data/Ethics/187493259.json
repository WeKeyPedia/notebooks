It is significantly broader than the common conception of analyzing right and wrong. A central aspect of ethics is \"the good life\", the life worth living or life that is satisfying, which is held by many philosophers to be more important than moral conduct. The major problem is the discovery of the ''[[summum bonum]]'', the greatest good. The right act can be identified as the one causing the greatest good and the immoral act as the one impeding it.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis.
