Rational development was considered the most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. [[Moderation]] was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, [[courage]] is the moderate virtue between the extremes of [[cowardice]] and [[recklessness]]. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by moderate virtue.
