Some philosophers rely on descriptive ethics and choices made and unchallenged by a [[society]] or [[culture]] to derive categories, which typically vary by context. This can lead to [[situational ethics]] and [[situated ethics]]. These philosophers often view [[aesthetics]], [[etiquette]], and [[arbitration]] as more fundamental, percolating \"bottom up\" to imply the existence of, rather than explicitly prescribe, theories of value or of conduct. The study of descriptive ethics may include examinations of the following: </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>* [[Ethical code]]s applied by various groups.
