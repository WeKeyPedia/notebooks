Some philosophers rely on descriptive ethics and choices made and unchallenged by a [[society]] or [[culture]] to derive categories, which typically vary by context. This can lead to [[situational ethics]] and [[situated ethics]]. These philosophers often view [[aesthetics]], [[etiquette]], and [[arbitration]] as more fundamental, percolating \"bottom up\" to imply the existence of, rather than explicitly prescribe, theories of value or of conduct.
