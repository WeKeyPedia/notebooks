In at least these traditions, ethics is not \"science\" but a question of applying imperfect human [[reason]] to interpreting [[revealed truth]] from divine sources. Theology, not philosophy, was considered to be the \"science of sciences\" in [[Roman Catholic]] thought, and this involves not just study but activism and evangelism to actively promote these views as \"gospel\". </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>*Ethics is inseparable from [[economics]] in some theories, notably [[Marxism]] and [[social ecology]], from [[family]] [[duty|duties]] in [[feminism]], and from [[gender]] in [[Queer studies]]. These views are said to represent workers, women, and sexual outcasts who have historically been degraded by traditional ethics. Because these groups exist everywhere humans do, globally, and because there are also clear material constraints on human existence on [[Earth]] that impose constraints also on behaviour, these views are usually now integrated with planet-wide, or \"global\" issues of human rights and conduct.
