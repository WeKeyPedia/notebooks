This leads to [[situational ethics]] and [[situated ethics]].  These philosophers often view [[aesthetics]] and [[etiquette]] and [[arbitration]] as more fundamental, percolating 'bottom up' to imply, rather than explicitly state, theories of value or of conduct.  In these views ethics is not derived from a top-down a priori \"philosophy\" (many would reject that word) but rather is strictly derived from observations of actual choices made in practice:</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>* [[Ethical code]]s applied by various groups. Some consider aesthetics itself the basis of ethics &amp;ndash; and a personal [[moral core]] developed through art and storytelling as very influential in one's later ethical choices.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>* Informal theories of [[etiquette]] which tend to be less rigorous and more situational.  Some consider etiquette a simple negative ethics, i.e. where can one evade an uncomfortable truth without doing wrong?  One notable advocate of this view is [[Judith Martin]] (\"Miss Manners\").  In this view, ethics is more a summary of common sense social decisions.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>* Practices in [[arbitration]] and [[law]], e.g. the claim by [[Rushworth Kidder]] that ethics itself is a matter of balancing \"right versus right\", i.e. putting priorities on two things that are both right, but which must be traded off carefully in each situation.  This view many consider to have potential to reform ethics as a practice, but it is not as widely held as the 'aesthetic' or 'common sense' views listed above.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>* Observed choices made by ordinary people, without expert aid or advice, who [[vote]], [[buy]] and decide what is worth fighting about.
