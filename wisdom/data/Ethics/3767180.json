For instance, the word \"rights\" implies that someone somewhere has \"duties\" to determine, uphold and protect them. There is some balance thus required to deal with questions of who has the rights, who has the duties, and how people are trained or supervised to actually perform the duties to provide the rights. A distinction between \"positive\" and \"negative\" rights is sometimes suggested; however, the so-called \"negative\" rights require provision for courts, judges, lawyers, training and infrastructure for same, prisons, and other things that presumably there is a \"positive\" right to.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==The analytic view==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==The analytic view==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 168:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 168:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>However, the term ''ethics'' is actually derived from the ancient Greek ''ethos'', meaning ''[[moral character]]''.

Another and perhaps the most critical weakness is that it usually assumes that a single point of view can be established from which all arguments can be evaluated and from which [[decision-making]] can be made and accepted. Many thinkers challenge some or all of these assumptions. Some assert that, like Christianity, it evolved in the context of imperial courts and rule, where such a single claimed-neutral point of view was \"in charge\".
