Another and perhaps the most critical weakness is that it usually assumes that a single point of view can be established from which all arguments can be evaluated and from which [[decision-making]] can be made and accepted. Many thinkers challenge some or all of these assumptions. Some assert that, like Christianity, it evolved in the context of imperial courts and rule, where such a single claimed-neutral point of view was \"in charge\". See [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]], [[cultural bias]], [[gender bias]], [[political virtues]] for ways of approaching this problem that include many that are defiant of Western traditions.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Ethics in religion==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Ethics in religion==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:3752599:newid:3752627 -->\n",
