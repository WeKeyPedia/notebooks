The biggest contributor to the anarchist ethics is the Russian zoologist, geographer, economist and political activist Peter Kropotkin. The anarchist ethics is a big and vague field which can depends upon different historical situations and different anarchist thinkers, but as [[Peter Kropotkin]] explains, \"any “bourgeois” or “proletarian” ethics rests, after all, on the common basis, on the common ethnological foundation, which at times exerts a very strong inﬂuence on the principles of the class or group morality.\" Still, most of the anarchist ethics schools are based on three fundamental ideas, which are: \"solidarity, equality and justice\". Kropotkin argues that Ethics is evolutionary and is inherited as a sort of a social instinct trough History, and by so, he rejects any religious and transcendental explanation of ethics. &lt;ref name=\"Ethics, Peter Kropotkin\"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics|link=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-ethics-origin-and-development.pdf}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Postmodern ethics===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Postmodern ethics===</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:618407342:newid:620745225 -->\n",
