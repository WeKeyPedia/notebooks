Spinoza's ethical principles were revived in the 20th century by a number of leading European thinkers, from [[Jacques Derrida]] to [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]]. Deleuze even wrote two books on Spinozist ethics, both carrying the title ''Spinoza''.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Postmodern ethics===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Postmodern ethics===</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:329422525:newid:329493772 -->\n",
