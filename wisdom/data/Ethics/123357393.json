He spoke out against (and wrote about) practices of [[psychiatrists]] which he considered inhumane or barbaric, such as [[Electro convulsive therapy|electric shock treatment]].  Like [[Wittgenstein]], he was frequently concerned with clarifying the use of language in the field — for example, he suggested that the effects of [[psychiatric drugs]] (some of which are very deleterious, such as tardive diskensia) be called just that: \"effects\", and not be referred to by the preferred euphemisms of the drug companies, who prefer to call them \"side effects\".

Although none of us can actually measure up to this standard, we nonetheless come to experience feelings of worthlessness (guilt) along with a corresponding reduction in the will to survive (depression) when we deviate from the standard to an unreasonable degree.
