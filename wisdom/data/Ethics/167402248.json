Ethics denotes the theory of right action and the greater good, while morals indicate their practice. Moral has a dual meaning. The first indicates a person's comprehension of morality and his capacity to put it into practice. In this meaning, the antonym is \"amoral\", indicating an inability to distinguish between right and wrong. The second denotes the active practice of those values. In this sense, the contrary word is \"immoral\", referring to actions that violate ethical principles. Personal ethics signifies a moral code applicable to individuals, while social ethics means moral theory applied to groups. Social ethics can be synonymous with social and political philosophy, inasmuch as it is the foundation of a good society or state. Ethics is not limited to specific acts and defined moral codes, but encompasses the whole of moral ideals and behaviors, a person's philosophy of life (or ''[[Weltanschauung]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis.

[[Knowledge]] having a bearing on human life was placed highest, all other knowledge being secondary. [[Self-knowledge]] was considered necessary for success and inherently an [[essential good]]. A self-aware person will act completely within their capabilities to their pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty.  To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existance, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good, if they know what is right. Evil, or bad actions, are the result of ignorance. If a criminal were truly aware of the mental and spiritual consequences of his actions, he would not commit them. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he equated knowledge with [[virtue]], he similarly equated virtue with [[happiness]].
