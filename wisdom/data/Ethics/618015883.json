Aristotle said, \"[[Nature]] does nothing in vain.\" Therefore, it is imperative for people to act in accordance with their nature and develop their latent talents in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as [[civic duty|civic life]] or [[wealth]], are merely means to the end. Self-realization, the awareness of one's nature and the development of one's talents, is the surest path to happiness.&lt;ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/&gt;{{rp|33–35}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 61:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 61:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===State consequentialism===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===State consequentialism===</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>{{Main|State consequentialism}}</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>{{Main|State consequentialism}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>[[State consequentialism]], also known as Mohist consequentialism,&lt;ref name=\"readings\"&gt;{{cite book<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>|<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>title<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>=<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>Readings in classical Chinese philosophy<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>|<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>year<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>=<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>2005<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>|<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>last<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>=Ivanhoe<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>|<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>first<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>=<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>P.J.<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>|<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>last2= Van Norden<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>|<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>first2= Bryan William<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>|publisher<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>=<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>[[Hackett Publishing]]<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>|<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>isbn<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>=<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del>978-0-87220-780-6|page=60|quote=\"he advocated a form of state consequentialism, which sought to maximize three basic goods: the wealth, order, and population of the state}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the basic goods of a state.&lt;ref name=<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">\"</del>readings<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">\"</del>/&gt; The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BC, as \"a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare.\"&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Chris, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/ Mohism]\", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' , Edward N.
