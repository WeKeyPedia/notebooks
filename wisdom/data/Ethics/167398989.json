Knowledge having a bearing on human life was placed highest, all other knowledge being secondary. Self-knowledge was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within their capabilities to their pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty.  To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existance, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good, if they know what is right. Evil, or bad actions, are the result of ignorance. If a criminal were truly aware of the mental and spiritual consequences of his actions, he would not commit them. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he equated knowledge with virtue, he similarly equated virtue with happiness. The truly wise man will know what is right, do what is good and therefore be happy.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis. ''Ideas of the Great Philosophers''. pp 32-33.

When a person acts in accordance with their nature and realizes their full potential, they will do good and be content. At birth, a baby is not a person, but a potential person. In order to become a \"real\" person, the child's inherent potential must be realized. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by the unrealized potential of a person, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Aristotle said, \"Nature does nothing in vain.\" Therefore, it is imperative a person acts according to their nature and develops their latent talent, in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as civic life or wealth, are merely means to the end. Self-realization, the awareness of one's nature and the development of one's talents, is the surest path to happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis.

Physical nature can be assuaged through exercise and care, emotional nature through indulgence of instinct and urges, and mental through human reason and developed potential. Rational development was considered the most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. Moderation was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, courage is the moderate virtue between the extremes of cowardice and recklessness. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by moderate virtue. This is regarded as difficult, as virtue denotes doing the right thing, to the right person, at the right time, to the proper extant, in the correct fashion, for the right reason.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis.
