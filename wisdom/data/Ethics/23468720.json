Some of this altruistic behaviour is explained by kin selection.

Should this sum be greater than zero a fitness gain will result from the sacrifice. When apparent altruism is not between kin, it may be based on reciprocity. A monkey will present its back to another monkey, who will pick out parasites; after a time the roles will be reversed.
