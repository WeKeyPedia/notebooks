Their debate is over the truth-aptitude of ethical propositions. Ethical propositions are those used to either positively or negatively morally evaluate something. Concepts of value, e.g. good and evil, or concepts of [[deontic logic|deontic modality]], e.g. obligation (\"should/ought\") and prohibition (\"should not/ought not\"), or similar concepts of other kinds (e.g. fairness and unfairness), are typically components of ethical propositions.

Moriah and its prefiguration of God the father's sacrifice of Christ. Organized religion may be seen as an extension of moral philosophy that seeks a system of thought that transcends the accepted ethical norms of a particular time.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Ethics and aesthetics===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Ethics and aesthetics===</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:77785772:newid:77795324 -->\n",
