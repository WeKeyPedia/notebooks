Theories of conduct propose standards of [[morality]], or [[moral code]]s or rules. For example, the following would be the sort of rules that a theory of conduct would discuss (though different theories will differ on the merit of each of these particular rules): \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\"; \"The right action is the action that produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number\"; \"Stealing is wrong\".  Theories of moral conduct can be distinguished from [[etiquette]] by their concern with finding guidelines for action that are not dependent entirely on social convention. For example, it may not be a breach of etiquette to fail to give money to help those in poverty, but it could still be a failure to act morally.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>*One branch of normative ethics is [[theory of conduct]]; this is the study of right and wrong, of obligation and permissions, of duty, of what is above and beyond the call of duty, and of what is so wrong as to be evil.

Suppose we have decided that certain things are intrinsically good, or are more valuable than other things that are also intrinsically good. Given this, the next big question is what would this imply about how we should live our lives? The theory of value also asks: What sorts of things are good? What sorts of situations are good? Is pleasure always good? Is it good for people to be equally well-off? Is it intrinsically good for beautiful objects to exist? Or: What does \"good\" mean?  It may literally define \"good\" and \"bad\" for a community or society.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>*Another branch of normative ethics is [[theory of value]]; this looks at what things are deemed to be valuable.
