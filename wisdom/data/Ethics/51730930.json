Often this is derived from some list of moral absolutes, e.g. a religious [[moral code]], whether explicit or not.  Some would view [[aesthetics]] as itself a form of meta-ethics.  Some philosophers, such as [[Kierkegaard]] viewed meta-ethics as a pursuit that could only be understood in terms of religion.  His Christian derived ethics is seen most clearly in the concept of a 'teleological suspension of the ethical' - a moment when ethical reality is superseded by religious reality, such as Abraham's sacrifice of his son Isaac on Mt.

For example, the following would be the sort of rules that a theory of conduct would discuss (though different theories will differ on the merit of each of these particular rules): \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\"; \"The right action is the action which produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number\"; \"Stealing is wrong\".  Theories of moral conduct can be distinguished from [[etiquette]] by their concern with finding guidelines for action that are not dependent entirely on social convention.

Is pleasure always good? Is it good for people to be equally well-off? Is it intrinsically good for beautiful objects to exist? Or: What does \"good\" mean?  It may literally define \"good\" and \"bad\" for a community or society. [Criticism: Theory of value is not a part of normative ethics, though normative ethics presupposes some theory of value.
