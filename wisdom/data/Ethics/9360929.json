Is pleasure always good? Is it good for people to be equally well-off? Is it intrinsically good for beautiful objects to exist? Or: What does \"good\" mean?  It may literally define \"good\" and \"bad\" for a community or society. [Criticism: Theory of value is not a part of normative ethics, though normative ethics presupposes some theory of value.
