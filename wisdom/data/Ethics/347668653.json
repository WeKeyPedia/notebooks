Apart from this basic outline, there is little else that can be unequivocally said about consequentialism as such.

According to hedonistic [[utilitarianism]], a good action is one that results in an increase in [[pleasure]], and the best action is one that results in the most pleasure for the greatest number. Closely related is [[eudaimonia|eudaimonic]] consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in [[Equality of outcome|material equality]] or [[Freedom (political)|political liberty]] instead of something like the more ephemeral \"pleasure\". Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.  Whether a particular consequentialist theory focuses on a single good or many, conflicts and tensions between different good states of affairs are to be expected and must be adjudicated.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>====Deontology====</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>{{Main|Deontological Ethics}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Deontological ethics or deontology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δέον}}, ''deon'', \"obligation, duty\"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is an approach to [[ethics]] that determines goodness or rightness from examining [[acts]], rather than third-party [[consequences]] of the act as in [[consequentialism]], or the [[intention]]s of the person doing the act as in [[virtue ethics]].  Deontologists look at rules and duties.&lt;ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the act may be considered the right thing to do even if it produces a bad consequence&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Robert G. 1967.

We have a ''duty'' to act in a way that does those things that are [[inherently]] good as acts (\"truth-telling\" for example), or follow an objectively obligatory rule (as in [[rule utilitarianism]]).

Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as [[intelligence]], [[perseverance]] and [[pleasure]], fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears to not be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffering, this seems to make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good: &lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing in the world—indeed nothing even beyond the world—can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a ''good will''.&lt;ref name=\"transition\" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Postmodern ethics===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Postmodern ethics===</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:347668583:newid:347668653 -->\n",
