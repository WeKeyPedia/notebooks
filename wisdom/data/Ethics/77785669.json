Their debate is over the truth-aptitude of ethical propositions. Ethical propositions are those used to either positively or negatively morally evaluate something. Concepts of value, e.g. good and evil, or concepts of [[deontic logic|deontic modality]], e.g. obligation (\"should/ought\") and prohibition (\"should not/ought not\"), or similar concepts of other kinds (e.g. fairness and unfairness), are typically components of ethical propositions. Here are some examples:</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>* \"Sally is a good person.\"</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>* \"People should not steal.\"</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>* \"The [[O.
