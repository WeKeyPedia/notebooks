The individual's will should be independent and inviolate. Allowing a person to disturb the mental equilibrium is in essence offering yourself in slavery.

Similarly, if someone should die, those close to them should hold to their serenity because the loved one was made of flesh and blood destined to death. Stoic philosophy says to accept things that cannot be changed, resigning oneself to existence and enduring in a rational fashion. Death is not feared. People do not \"lose\" their life, but instead \"return\", for they are returning to God (who initially gave what the person is as a person).

They are spiritual exercises needed for the health of the spirit, just as physical exercise is required for the health of the body.
