It involves such questions as: Are ethical claims truth-apt, i.e., capable of being true or false, or are they, for example, expressions of emotion (see [[cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]])? If they are truth-apt, are they ever true? If they are ever true, what is the nature of the facts that they express? And are they ever true absolutely (see [[moral absolutism]]), or always only relative to some individual, society, or culture? (See [[moral relativism]], [[cultural relativism]].)</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Meta-ethics studies the nature of ethicaljhik;vgl;vfyfrc6y yto gtup;gtyh sentences and attitudes. This includes such questions as what \"good\" and \"right\" ''mean'', whether and how we ''know'' what is right and good, whether moral values are objective, and how ethical attitudes motivate us.  Often this is derived from some list of moral absolutes, e.g. a religious [[moral code]], whether explicit or not.  Some would view [[aesthetics]] as itself a form of meta-ethics.  Some philosophers, such as [[Kierkegaard]] viewed meta-ethics as a pursuit that could only be understood in terms of religion.  His Christian derived ethics is seen most clearly in the concept of a 'teleological suspension of the ethical' - a moment when ethical reality is superseded by religious reality, such as Abraham's sacrifice of his son Isaac on Mt. Moriah and its prefiguration of God the father's sacrifice of Christ.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Meta-ethics also investigates where our ethical principles come from, and what they mean. Are they merely social inventions? Do they involve more than expressions of our individual emotions? Meta-ethical answers to these questions focus on the issues of universal truths, the will of God, the role of reason in ethical judgments, and the meaning of ethical terms themselves. The goal of moral philosophy has been to find a system of thought that would transcent culture and time. An organized religion is often an extention of this moral philosophy, especially when the moral teachings / or interpretations are accepted but it's followers.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Normative ethics ==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Normative ethics ==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:54430879:newid:54431013 -->\n",
