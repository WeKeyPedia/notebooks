[[Socrates]] (469&amp;nbsp;BC – 399&amp;nbsp;BC) was one of the first [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind. In this view, [[knowledge]] having a bearing on human life was placed highest, all other knowledge being secondary. [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]] was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within his capabilities to his pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty.  To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existence, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good, if they know what is right. Evil or bad actions are the result of ignorance. If a criminal were truly aware of the mental and spiritual consequences of his actions, he would neither commit nor even consider committing those actions. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he correlated knowledge with [[virtue]], he similarly equated virtue with [[happiness]]. The truly wise man will know what is right, do what is good, and therefore be happy.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis. ''Ideas of the Great Philosophers''. pp 32-33.
