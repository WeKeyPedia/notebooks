If they are truth-apt, are they ever true? If they are ever true, what is the nature of the facts that they express?

Their debate is over the truth-aptitude of ethical propositions. Ethical propositions are those used to either positively or negatively morally evaluate something. Concepts of value, e.g. good and evil, or concepts of [[deontic logic|deontic modality]], e.g. obligation (\"should/ought\") and prohibition (\"should not/ought not\"), or similar concepts of other kinds (e.g. fairness and unfairness), are typically components of ethical propositions.
