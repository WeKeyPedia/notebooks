As such, there is a connection between the ethics of the Bible and the ethics of the great western philosophers.  However, this is not a direct connection; significant differences of opinion in how to interpret and apply passages in the books of the Bible lead to different understandings of ethics. Thus, one should not expect to find a direct correlation between Biblical ethics and post-Enlightenment philosophical study of ethics, nor should one find no correlation at all, either. [[Ethics in the Bible]] is a survey of ethics in the Hebrew Bible and in the New Testament.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Related Topics (in philosophy) ==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Related Topics (in philosophy) ==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:1357281:newid:1358388 -->\n",
