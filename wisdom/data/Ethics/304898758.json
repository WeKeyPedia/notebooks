In Aristotle's view, when a person acts in accordance with his nature and realises his full potential, he will do good and be content. At birth, a baby is not a person, but a potential person. In order to become a \"real\" person, the child's inherent potential must be realised. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by the unrealised potential of a person, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Aristotle said, \"[[Nature]] does nothing in vain.\" Therefore, it is imperative for persons to act in accordance with their nature and develop their latent talents, in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as [[civic duty|civic life]] or [[wealth]], are merely means to the end. [[Self-realization]], the awareness of one's nature and the development of one's talents, is the surest path to happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis.

Rational development was considered the most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. [[Moderation]] was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, [[courage]] is the moderate virtue between the extremes of [[cowardice]] and [[recklessness (psychology)|recklessness]].
