[[Deep ecology]] is a quite complete expression of that idea but is considered very radical: In effect, it argues that humans must do what is good for the Earth's biosphere not what is good for humans. Only by doing so can they survive. There is some basis for this in biology which often observes that animals tend to compete more with their own species than with all others - thus, to wait until all disputes between humans are settled before dealing with their [[overconsumption]] and [[waste]], and such matters as [[biodiversity]], can only guarantee disaster. It is only effective to start with the biosphere and reduce conflict by making it richer, or humans less numerous. </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>=== Ethics without politics ===</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Of course, ecology and biology are sciences, as is chemistry on which they are based.
