It deals with the way of human thinking and acting in relation to the significance of the Earth as a system and as a model. Geoeducational, scientific, technological, methodological and social-cultural aspects are included (e.g. sustainability, development, geodiversity and geoheritage, prudent consumption of mineral resources, appropriate measures for predictability and mitigation of natural hazards, geoscience communication, museology, etc). In addition, the necessity of considering appropriate protocols, scientific integrity issues and a code of good practice - regarding  the study of the abiotic world - is covered by this discipline. Studies on planetary geology (sensu lato) and astrobiology also require a geoethical approach.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>====Business Ethics====</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>====Business Ethics====</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:511808748:newid:512222608 -->\n",
