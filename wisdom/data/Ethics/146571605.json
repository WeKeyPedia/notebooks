Although none of us can actually measure up to this standard, we nonetheless come to experience feelings of worthlessness (guilt) along with a corresponding reduction in the will to survive (depression) when we deviate from the standard to an unreasonable degree. In other words, the capacity to experience guilt (having a conscience) is a part of the price we humans have had to pay for having become a little too objective for our own good.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rationology.net&lt;/ref&gt;}}</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>===Legal ethics===</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>{{main|Legal ethics}}</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Ethics has been applied to [[criminology]] leading to the field of [[criminal justice]].</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>==See also==</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>{{Wikiversity}}</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>{|width=100%</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>|-valign=top</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>|width=50%|</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>*[[Empathy]]</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>*[[Ethicism]]</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>* [[Moral absolutism]]</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>** [[Divine command theory|Divine command ethics]]</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>** [[Universal prescriptivism]]</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>* The ''prima facie'' ethics of [[W.
