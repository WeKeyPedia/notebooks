However, in ethics the issues are most often multifaceted and the best proposed actions address many different areas concurrently.

Many buttons are pushed so that the overall condition is improved and not to the benefit of any particular faction.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Post-critique ethics===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Post-critique ethics===</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:277858044:newid:277859161 -->\n",
