The ''[[theory of conduct]]'' studies, on a general level, what sorts of actions are morally wrong, permissible, obligatory, and supererogatory (beyond the call of duty). So theories of conduct propose standards of [[morality]], or [[moral code]]s or rules. For example, the following would be the sort of rules that a theory of conduct would discuss (though different theories will differ on the merit of each of these particular rules): \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\"; \"The right action is the action that produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number\"; \"Stealing is wrong.\"  Here is where it is difficult to distinguish a theory from practice of [[etiquette]].</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>4. ''[[Applied ethics]]'' applies ethical theories to particular ethical problems.  Many of these ethical problems bear directly on public policy. For example, the following would be questions of applied ethics: \"Is getting an [[abortion]] ever moral?\"; \"Is [[euthanasia]] ever moral?\"; \"What are the ethical underpinnings of [[affirmative action]] policies?\"; \"Do animals have rights?\"  Without these questions there is no clear fulcrum on which to balance [[law]], [[politics]], and practice of [[arbitration]] - in fact no common assumptions of all participants - so the ability to formulate the questions are prior to rights balancing.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>But not ''all'' questions studied in applied ethics concern public policy.
