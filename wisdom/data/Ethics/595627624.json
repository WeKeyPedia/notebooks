It is the branch of [[Philosophy|philosophical]] ethics that investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. Normative ethics is distinct from [[meta-ethics]] because it examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts. Normative ethics is also distinct from [[descriptive ethics]], as the latter is an empirical investigation of people's moral beliefs. To put it another way, descriptive ethics would be concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that killing is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is correct to hold such a belief. Hence, normative ethics is sometimes called prescriptive, rather than descriptive.
