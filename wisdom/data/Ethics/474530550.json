Moore]]'s famous work ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' from 1903. In it he first wrote about what he called ''the [[naturalistic fallacy]]''. Moore was seen to reject [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] in ethics, in his [[Open Question Argument]]. This made thinkers look again at second order questions about ethics. Earlier, the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] had put forward a similar view on the difference between [[Is-ought problem|facts and values]].</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Studies of how we know in ethics divide into [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]]; This is similar to the contrast between [[descriptivist theory of names|descriptivists]] and non-descriptivists. Non-cognitivism is the claim that when we judge something as right or wrong, this is neither true nor false. We may, e.g. be only expressing our emotional feelings about these things.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/non-cogn/&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitivism can then be seen as the claim that when we talk about right and wrong, we are talking about matters of fact.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>The [[ontology]] of ethics is about value-bearing things or properties, i.e. the kind of things or stuff referred to by ethical propositions. Non-descriptivists and non-cognitivists believe that ethics does not need a specific ontology, since ethical propositions do not refer. This is known as an anti-realist position. Realists on the other hand must explain what kind of entities, properties or states are relevant for ethics, how they have value, and why they guide and motivate our actions.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C.
