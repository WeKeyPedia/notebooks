[[Deep ecology]] is a quite complete expression of that idea but is considered very radical:  In effect, it argues that humans must do what is good for the Earth's biosphere not what is good for humans.  Only by doing so can they survive.  There is some basis for this in [[biology]] which often observes that animals tend to compete more with their own species than with all others - thus, to wait until all disputes between humans are settled before dealing with their [[overconsumption]] and [[waste]], and such matters as [[biodiversity]], can only guarantee disaster.  It is only effective to start with the [[biosphere]] and reduce conflict by making it richer, or humans less numerous.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Ethics has been applied to [[criminology]] leading to the field of [[criminal justice]].</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Ethics has been applied to [[criminology]] leading to the field of [[criminal justice]].</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:1425888:newid:1427604 -->\n",
