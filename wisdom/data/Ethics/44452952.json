[[Psychology|Psychologists]] such as [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] developed theories which are based on the idea that moral behavior is made possible by moral reasoning. Their theories subdivided moral reasoning into so-called stages, which refer to the set of principles or methods that a person uses for ethical judgment.

One of the most famous humanistic theories is [[Abraham Maslow|Abraham Maslow's]] [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]]. Maslow argued that the highest human need is [[self-actualization]], which can be described as fulfilling one's potential, and trying to fix what is wrong in the world. [[Carl Rogers|Carl Rogers's]] work was based on similar assumptions. He thought that in order to be a 'fully functioning person', one has to be creative and accept one's own feelings and needs. He also emphasized the value of self-actualization. A similar theory was proposed by [[Fritz Perls]], who assumed that taking responsibility of one's own life is an important value.  </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>[[R.D. Laing]] developed a broad range of thought on interpersonal psychology.  This deals with interactions between people, which he considered important, for an ethical action always occurs between one person and another.  In books such as The Politics of Experience, he dealt with issues concerning how we should relate to persons labeled by the psychiatric establishment as \"schizophrenic\".  He came to be seen as a champion for the rights of those considered mentally ill.  He spoke out against (and wrote about) practices of psychiatrists which he considered inhumane or barbaric, such as electric shock treatment.  Like Wittgenstein, he was frequently concerned with clarifying the use of language in the field -- so, for example, he suggested that the effects of psychiatric drugs (some of which are very deleterious, such as tardive diskensia) be called just that: \"effects\", and not be referred to by the preferred euphemisms of the drug companies, who prefer to call them \"side effects\".  Laing also did work in establishing true asylums as places of refuge for those who feel disturbed and want a safe place to go through whatever it is they want to explore in themselves, and with others.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>A third group of psychological theories that have implications for the nature of ethics are based on [[evolutionary psychology]].
