Only by doing so can they survive.  There is some basis for this in [[biology]] which often observes that animals tend to compete more with their own species than with all others - thus, to wait until all disputes between humans are settled before dealing with their [[overconsumption]] and [[waste]], and such matters as [[biodiversity]], can only guarantee disaster.
