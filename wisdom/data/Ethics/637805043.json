Firstly, the designers should have considered previous designs, which, although were expensive, were durable and sustainable. Moisseiff should have designed a stable bridge that would consider the safety of the public and avoid unnecessary wastage of funds. Although it would mean that the project would be expensive, the result would have eventually been cheaper, considering the amount wasted in the destroyed project. Alternatively, innovative techniques are necessary to ensure that there is progress. Although it may be risky, there is always headway for future engineers as they explore new techniques. </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>The [[ontology]] of ethics is about value-bearing things or properties, i.e. the kind of things or stuff referred to by ethical propositions.
