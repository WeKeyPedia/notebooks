It can refer to philosophical ethics -- a project that attempts to use reason in order to answer various kinds of ethical questions. It can also be used to describe a particular person's own, idiosyncratic principles or habits. For example: \"Joe has good ethics.\" It may also be used to characterize the questions of right-conduct in some specific sphere, even when such right-conduct is not examined philosophically: \"business ethics,\" or \"the ethics of child-rearing\" may refer, but need not refer, to a philosophical examination of such issues. This article describes philosophical ethics, which is more or less synonymous with \"ethical theory,\" but this is not the exclusive use of the term \"ethics\" in English. Even something such as \"bioethics,\" may be addressed from a philosophical or non-philosophical perspective. For example, a nonphilosopher may well have an opinion about end-of-life care, and such an opinion falls within the domain of bioethics.
