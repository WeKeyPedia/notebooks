[[Socrates]] (469&amp;nbsp;BC – 399&amp;nbsp;BC) was one of the first [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind. In this view, [[knowledge]] having a bearing on human life was placed highest, all other knowledge being secondary. [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]] was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within his capabilities to his pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty.  To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existence, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good, if they know what is right. Evil or bad actions are the result of ignorance. If a criminal was truly aware of the intellectual and spiritual consequences of his actions, he would neither commit nor even consider committing those actions. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he correlated knowledge with [[virtue]], he similarly equated virtue with [[joy]]. The truly wise man will know what is right, do what is good, and therefore be happy.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis.

At birth, a baby is not a person, but a potential person. To become a \"real\" person, the child's inherent potential must be realized. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by the unrealized potential of a person, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Aristotle said, \"[[Nature]] does nothing in vain.\" Therefore, it is imperative for people to act in accordance with their nature and develop their latent talents in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as [[civic duty|civic life]] or [[wealth]], are merely means to the end. Self-realization, the awareness of one's nature and the development of one's talents, is the surest path to happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis.
