Ethics denotes the theory of right action and the greater good, while morals indicate their practice. \"Moral\" has a dual meaning. The first indicates a person's comprehension of morality and his capacity to put it into practice. In this meaning, the antonym is \"amoral\", indicating an inability to distinguish between right and wrong. The second denotes the active practice of those values. In this sense, the antonym is \"immoral\", referring to actions that violate ethical principles.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Personal ethics signifies a moral code applicable to individuals, while social ethics means moral theory applied to groups.
