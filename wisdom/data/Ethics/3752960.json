For instance, the word \"rights\" implies that someone somewhere has \"duties\" to determine, uphold and protect them. There is some balance thus required to deal with questions of who has the rights, who has the duties, and how people are trained or supervised to actually perform the duties to provide the rights. A distinction between \"positive\" and \"negative\" rights is sometimes suggested; however, the so-called \"negative\" rights require provision for courts, judges, lawyers, training and infrastructure for same, prisons, and other things that presumably there is a \"positive\" right to.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==The analytic view==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==The analytic view==</div></td>\n</tr>\n",
