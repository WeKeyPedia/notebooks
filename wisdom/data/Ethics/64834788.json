This includes such questions as what \"good\" and \"right\" ''mean'', whether and how we ''know'' what is right and good, whether moral values are objective, and how ethical attitudes motivate us.  Often this is derived from some list of moral absolutes, e.g. a religious [[moral code]], whether explicit or not.  Some would view [[aesthetics]] as itself a form of meta-ethics.  Some philosophers, such as [[Kierkegaard]] viewed meta-ethics as a pursuit that could only be understood in terms of religion.  His Christian derived ethics is seen most clearly in the concept of a 'teleological suspension of the ethical' - a moment when ethical reality is superseded by religious reality, such as Abraham's sacrifice of his son Isaac on Mt. Moriah and its prefiguration of God the father's sacrifice of Christ. Organized religion may be seen as an extension of moral philosophy that seeks a system of thought that transcends accepted ethical norms of a particular time.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Meta-ethics studies the nature of ethical sentences and attitudes.
