As Nietzsche's example shows, this is not always a direct connection - it may be reactive or even dismissive.  However, even among religious scholars, significant differences of opinion in the applicability, or how to interpret and apply passages in the books of the Bible lead to different understandings of ethics. Thus, one should not expect to find any direct correlation between Biblical ethics and post-[[Enlightenment]] philosophical study of ethics, nor should one find no correlation at all, either.
