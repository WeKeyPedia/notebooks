It is the attempt to arrive at general moral standards that tell us how to judge right from wrong, or good from bad, and how to live moral lives. This may involve articulating the character or good habits that we should acquire, the duties that we should follow, or the consequences of our behavior on ourselves and others. There are three main approaches to normative ethics.  </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Normative ethicists who follow the first approach are often called [[virtue ethics|virtue ethicists]], and articulate the various virtues or good habits that should be acquired.

This leads to [[situational ethics]] and [[situated ethics]].  These philosophers often view [[aesthetics]], [[etiquette]], and [[arbitration]] as more fundamental, percolating \"bottom up\" to imply, rather than explicitly state, theories of value or of conduct.  In these views ethics is not derived from a top-down ''a priori'' \"philosophy\" (many would reject that word) but rather is strictly derived from observations of actual choices made in practice:</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>* [[Ethical code]]s applied by various groups.

Some consider etiquette a simple negative ethics, i.e. where can one evade an uncomfortable truth without doing wrong?  One notable advocate of this view is [[Judith Martin]] (\"Miss Manners\").
