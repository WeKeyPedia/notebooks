It is also influenced by many factors such as culture and religious. The most significant factor for one person’s life is to have a good ethic with dignity. They seem to be in pairs. If someone has a bad ethic, he or she appears to be lack of self-esteem. Hence, try to reach your goal as a respectable person with good moral values by passing your life. For your self-benefit to be a successful or rich person, you never walk on the wrong path or cheat to the others regardless of other people. As a result, you might be happy and wealthy for a moment but it won’t take longer. An actual wealth for a person seems to be wisdom. People may ignore a rich person but they can never neglect the wisdom of a wise person because wisdom is much worth possessing than a treasure island. There is sensibility behind that wisdom which will distinguish right and wrong matters for life. Therefore, learning ethic means not just for caring of better dignity for life. It is also for exploring the valuable knowledge and planting the precious wisdom in brain for respectable life. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>According to Tomas Paul and Linda Elder of the [[Foundation for Critical Thinking]], \"most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs and the law\", and don't treat ethics as a stand-alone concept.&lt;ref name=\"ReferenceA\"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|edition= |last1= Paul|first1= Richard|last2= Elder|first2= Linda|year= 2006|publisher= Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location= United States|isbn= 0-944583-17-2|page= np}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul and Elder define ethics as \"a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures\".&lt;ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/&gt;  The ''When we expand the word “philosophy”, it comes out with different solutions or visions.
