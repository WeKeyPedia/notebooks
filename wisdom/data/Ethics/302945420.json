Wallace writes: \"Moral psychology is the study of morality in its psychological dimensions\" (p. 86).&lt;/ref&gt; Such topics are ones that involve the mind and are relevant to moral issues. Some of the main topics of the field are [[moral responsibility]], [[moral development]], [[moral character]] (especially as related to [[virtue ethics]]), [[altruism]], [[psychological egoism]], [[moral luck]], and moral disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;See Doris &amp; Stich (2008), §1.&lt;/ref&gt;</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Evolutionary ethics===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Evolutionary ethics===</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>{{<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">see</del> also|Evolutionary ethics|Evolution of morality}}</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>{{<ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">See</ins> also|Evolutionary ethics|Evolution of morality}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Evolutionary ethics concerns approaches to ethics (morality) based on the role of evolution in shaping human psychology and behavior.
