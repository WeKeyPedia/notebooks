We take this for granted. It's the American Way.  In the middle of 19th century we, as a nation, had a conversation about our ‘ethics’ – we decided that people couldn't ‘own’ people. We decided that human beings are entitled to a freedom befitting their human beingness – that human beings can’t be property –can’t be slaves. 150 years later we must again take up this conversation. Today we face the question are human being’s ‘assets’? Do we agree that a person or group of people, may, in the pursuit of their separate economic interests, engage in the intentional manipulation of the behavior of other human beings? We have seen what Madison Ave. can do with tobacco company ethics, lucasfilm's  technology concepts, Spielberg’s attention direction and with the right 'star attractions'.  We have a semi-hypnotized society - hypnotized into accepting manipulation as normal, hypnotized into a lack of respect for their own learning.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Environmental ethics===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Environmental ethics===</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:155669964:newid:155744700 -->\n",
