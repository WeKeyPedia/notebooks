It may refer to philosophical ethics—a project that attempts to use reason in order to investigate ethical questions. Ethics may also refer to a non-philosophical examination of such issues. Larry Churchill writes: \"Ethics, understood as the capacity to think critically about moral values and direct our actions in terms of such values, is a generic human capacity. Except for sociopaths, it is common to all of us, and skill in ethics does not lend itself easily to encapsulation in theoretical categories, or a professional specialty.\"&lt;ref&gt;Larry Churchill, \"Are We Professionals? A Critical Look at the Social Role of Bioethicists.\" Daedalus 1999: pp. 253-274.&lt;/ref&gt; The English term ethics may also be used to describe a particular person's own, idiosyncratic principles or habits. For example: \"Joe has good ethics.\" It may also be used to characterize the questions of right-conduct in some specific sphere, even when such right-conduct is not examined philosophically: \"business ethics,\" or \"the ethics of child-rearing\" may refer, but need not refer, to a philosophical examination of such issues.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Richard Paul and Linda Elder of the Foundation for Critical Thinking define ethics as \"a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures\".&lt;ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/&gt; The ''[[Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' states that the word ethics is \"commonly used interchangeably with '[[morality]]'&amp;nbsp;... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual.\"&lt;ref&gt;John Deigh in Robert Audi (ed), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul and Elder state that, \"most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs and the law\", and don't treat ethics as a stand-alone concept.&lt;ref name=\"ReferenceA\"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|edition= |last1= Paul|first1= Richard|last2= Elder|first2= Linda|year= 2006|publisher= Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location= United States|isbn= 0-944583-17-2|page= np}}&lt;/ref&gt;</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Richard Paul and Linda Elder of the Foundation for Critical Thinking define ethics as \"a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures\".&lt;ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/&gt; The ''[[Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' states that the word ethics is \"commonly used interchangeably with '[[morality]]'&amp;nbsp;... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual.\"&lt;ref&gt;John Deigh in Robert Audi (ed), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul and Elder state that, \"most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs and the law\", and don't treat ethics as a stand-alone concept.&lt;ref name=\"ReferenceA\"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|edition= |last1= Paul|first1= Richard|last2= Elder|first2= Linda|year= 2006|publisher= Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location= United States|isbn= 0-944583-17-2|page= np}}&lt;/ref&gt;</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>The word ethics in English can mean several things.
