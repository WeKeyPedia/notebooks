Is pleasure always good? Is it good for people to be equally well-off? Is it intrinsically good for beautiful objects to exist? Or: What does \"good\" mean?  It may literally define \"good\" and \"bad\" for a community or society. [Criticism: Theory of value is not a part of normative ethics, though normative ethics presupposes some theory of value.

[[casuistry|Casuistry]] is a completely different form of applied ethics that is widely used in these cases and by these groups.  Casuists compare moral dilemmas to [[paradigm]]s (well established cases).
