Important Greek ethicists include the [[Sophists]] along with [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], who developed [[ethical naturalism]] and forms the foundation of what is now referred to as [[virtue ethics]]. The study of ethics was developed further by [[Epicurus]] and the [[Epicureanism|epicurean]] movement, and by the [[stoicism|stoics]] starting with [[Zeno of Citium]]. However the stoics did not delve into the topic with the same rational rigor as Aristotle in his Nicomachean ethics, the product of his own lectures and discourses with his teacher Plato, and other Athenian intellectuals.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>In Europe, the formal study of philosophy stagnated until the medieval era of [[Maimonides]],  [[Thomas Aquinas]] and others.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was influenced by both Kant and Schopenhauer but developed ethics into a new direction becoming a powerful critic of the 19th century moral climate, arguing that concepts such as true and false (and good and evil) are merely interpretations of reality.
