One may not see it or touch it, but one can surely sense it and feel it. '''Love is trust'''. If trust is lost, love cannot sustain under any circumstances. Moreover, once trust is lost it is extremely difficult to regain the same.  '''Love is selflessness'''. There goes a philosophy saying; the distance between A to B may not always be the same as distance between B to A. It means, you may choose to love someone with whatever intensity but that doesn't necessarily mean the other person must reciprocate. Overall, love is much more than what can be defined or expressed. Unfortunate are the people, who are loved but fail to honor the same for whatsoever reason.''</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>In English, love refers to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from pleasure (\"I loved that meal\") to [[interpersonal attraction]] (\"I love my partner\"). \"Love\" may refer specifically to the passionate desire and intimacy of [[romance (love)|romantic love]], to the sexual love of [[eros (concept)|eros]], to the emotional closeness of [[familial love|familial]] love, to the [[platonic love]] that defines [[friendship]],&lt;ref name=\"PlatonicSchool\"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kristeller |first=Paul Oskar |title=Renaissance Thought and the Arts: Collected Essays |publisher=Princeton University |year=1980 |isbn=0-691-02010-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to the profound [[Henosis|oneness]] or devotion of [[Religious views on love|religious love]]&lt;ref name=\"Gita\"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mascaró |first=Juan |title=The Bhagavad Gita |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=2003 |isbn=0-14-044918-3}} (J.
