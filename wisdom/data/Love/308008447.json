The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come ''amans''—a lover, amator, \"professional lover,\" often with the accessory notion of lechery—and ''amica'', \"girlfriend\" in the English sense, often as well being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is ''amor'' (the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City, [[Rome]]—in Latin: ''Roma''—can be viewed as an [[anagram]] for ''amor'', which was <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">the</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">well</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">known</del> secret name of the City in ancient times),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, Reden und Schweigen, Munich, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces ''amicus''—\"friend\"—and ''amicitia'', \"friendship\" (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to \"indebtedness\" or \"influence\"). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia''), which discusses the notion at some length.
