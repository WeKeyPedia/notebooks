It shows that the emotions are the love energy polarity spectrum, with positive emotions being different frequencies of love, and the negative emotions being different frequencies of antilove.  Psycanics considers that the idea that love is just one small band of positive emotion is deficient; that the love energy is all the emotions from the most negative to the most positive. Internally, love is a feeling, an experience.  Externally, love is action, and is positive love or antilove, depending on whether the actions and their results increase the other's wellbeing, or diminish or damage it.  Psycanics notes that the emotion-love energy is the only happiness or suffering that exists.  Therefore, love, emotions, and happiness or pain are all the same thing, the same energy, the same experience.    </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Cultural differences make any universal definition of love difficult to establish.
