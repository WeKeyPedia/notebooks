And in contrast to the definition at the top, frequently people use the verb \"love\" to indicate want or desire for themselves as opposed to for another. For example</ins>:<ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> \"I love that lamp,\" does not refer to desiring wellness for the lamp, but rather to the desire for the lamp.

Expressions of love may include the love for a soul or mind, the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, and love for the respect of others.  Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive.  Love is essentially an abstract concept, easier to experience than to explain.  Many believe, as stated originally by Virgil that \"Love conquers all\", or as stated by The Beatles, \"All you need is love\".  Bertrand Russell describes love as a condition of 'absolute value', as opposed to 'relative value'.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Types==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Types==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>*[[Courtly love]] – a late medieval conventionalized code prescribing certain conduct and emotions for ladies and their lovers</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>*[[Courtly love]] – a late medieval conventionalized code prescribing certain conduct and emotions for ladies and their lovers</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>*[[Erotic love]] – <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">illegal</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">in</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">13</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">states</del></div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>*[[Erotic love]] – <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">desire</ins> <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">characterized</ins> <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">by</ins> <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">sexual desires</ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>*[[Familial love]] – affection brokered through kinship connections, intertwined with concepts of attachment and bonding</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>*[[Familial love]] – affection brokered through kinship connections, intertwined with concepts of attachment and bonding</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>*[[Free love]] – sexual relations according to choice and unrestricted by marriage</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>*[[Free love]] – sexual relations according to choice and unrestricted by marriage</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:66016662:newid:66016718 -->\n",
