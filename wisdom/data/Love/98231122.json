''Intimacy'' is a form by which two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives.  Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. ''Commitment'' on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion.

These chemicals include; [[Testosterone]], [[Oestrogen]], [[Dopamine]], [[Norepinephrine]], [[Serotonin]], [[Oxytocin]], and [[Vasopressin]]. More specifically, higher levels of Testosterone and Oestrogen are present during the lustful phase of a relationship. Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and Serotonin are more commonly found during the attraction phase of a relationship. Oxytocin, and Vasopressin seemed to be more closely linked to long term bonding and relationships characterized by strong attachments.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>In 2005, Italian scientists at [[Pavia University]] found that a protein molecule known as the [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these levels return to as they were after one year.
