Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. There are probably elements of truth in both views &amp;mdash; certainly love is influenced by [[hormone]]s (such as [[oxytocin]]) and [[pheromone]]s, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by one’s conceptions of love.  Hence, from time immemorial, science, from [[nature|naturalistic]] [[poetry]] to [[MRI]] [[neurochemistry]], has since debated over the nature of love.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Cultural views==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Cultural views==</div></td>\n</tr>\n",
