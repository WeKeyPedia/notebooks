Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. Eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. Some translations list it as \"love of the body.\" </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 198:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 198:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>''[[Storge]]'' ({{polytonic|&amp;#963;&amp;#964;&amp;#959;&amp;#961;&amp;#947;&amp;#942;}} ''storgē'') is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring. </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>''[[Storge]]'' ({{polytonic|&amp;#963;&amp;#964;&amp;#959;&amp;#961;&amp;#947;&amp;#942;}} ''storgē'') is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div> </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div> </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>''[[Xenia (Greek)|Xenia]]'' (ξενία ''xenía''), hospitality, was an extremely important practice in Ancient Greece.
