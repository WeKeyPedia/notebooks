For example, ancient Greek has the words ''[[philia]]'', ''[[Eros (god)|eros]]'', ''[[agape]]'', and ''[[storge]]'', meaning love between friends, romantic/sexual love, unconditional (possibly sacrificial, unreciprocated) love, and affection/familial love respectively. However, with Greek as with many other languages, it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally, and so we can find examples of ''agape'' being used with much the same meaning as ''eros''.
