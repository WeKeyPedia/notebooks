Love often involves caring for or identifying with a person or thing, including oneself (cf. [[narcissism]]).In this use, love is actually the greatest proportion on selfishness, in that one only wants one thing, and that is for another being to be happy, and the one in love will do anything to fulfill this wish. This case however, does not necessarily end in marriage, because another may make the loved one happier, meaning the lover will give the other up.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>In ordinary use, ''love'' usually refers to interpersonal love, an experience felt by a person for another person.
