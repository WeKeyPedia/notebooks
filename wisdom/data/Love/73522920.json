Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. [[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] created his [[Triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: Intimacy, Commitment, and Passion. Intimacy is a form where two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives.  Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is simply sex, or passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. This led researchers such as Yela to further refine the model by separating Passion into two independents components: Erotic Passion and Romantic Passion.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Biological models of sex tend to see it as a [[mammal]]ian drive, just like [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].
