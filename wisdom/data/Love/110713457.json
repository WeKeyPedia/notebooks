[[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], a leading expert in the topic of love, divides the experience of love into three partly-overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment.<ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">  According to her research, most marriage around the world end within four years, which is precisely the time needed to rear a child through infancy.  Fisher has concluded that biologically, humans are wired for a succession of relationships that lasts long enough for reproduction and the raising of an infant to a child, rather than the romanticized idea that love and marriage are eternal. The focus, therefore, is on mating.  </ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[Lust]] is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes [[mating]], and involves the increased release of chemicals such as [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]].
