And in contrast to the definition at the top, frequently people use the verb \"love\" to indicate want or desire for themselves as opposed to for another. For example: \"I love ice cream,\" does not refer to desiring wellness for ice cream, but rather to the desire for ice cream. The word also frequently indicates elevated appreciation or admiration: \"I love that artist.\" </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Cultural differences make any universal definition of love difficult to establish. See the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. Expressions of love may include the love for a [[soul]] or mind, the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, love for the respect of others, et cetera. Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an abstract concept, easier to experience than to explain. Many believe, as stated originally by [[Virgil]], that \"''Love conquers all''\", or as stated by [[The Beatles]], \"[[all you  need is love]]\".</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>[[Bertrand Russell]] describes love as a condition of 'absolute value', as opposed to 'relative value'.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Types ==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Types ==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:59515466:newid:59544909 -->\n",
