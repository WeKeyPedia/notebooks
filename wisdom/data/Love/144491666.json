A third view, pantheism, recognizes a state or truth distinct from (and often antagonistic to) the idea that there is a difference between the worshiping subject and the worshiped object.

[[I John]] 4:8 states \"God is Love\".  In essence, God is the epitomy of love - in action and relation.  It is God that first loved mankind and desired a relationship. (John 3:16-17)  Love is the underlying drive in most people.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  The search for love seems endless within the human race, throughout the ages.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  The Bible defines God as being the completeness of love.  Love, as being defined by Him, is demonstrated in his character and personality. Another way of defining this type of love is \"godly love\", a love shown through the example of Christ's sacrifice on the cross. However, this \"sacrificial\" love can also be expressed by humans, although imperfectly. For example, the love of a mother for her child. Many mothers would sacrifice anything for their children. It is this type of love that the Bible teaches us to follow and to share with one another. Love, in the end, is truly a sacrifice, ultimately expressed in the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]] as described in the [[New Testament]].  C.S.
