There is no direct references stating that God is love, but amongst the 99 names of God, there is the name ''Al-Wadud'' or \"the Loving One,\" which is found in Surah 11:90 as well as Surah 85:14. It refers Allah as being \"full of loving kindness.\" In Islam, love is more often than not used as an incentive for the sinners to aspire to be as worthy for a God's love as they may. One still has God's love, but how the person evaluates his own worth is to his own and Allah's own counsel. All who hold the faith have Allah's love, but to what degree or effort he has pleased God depends on the individual itself. -rechecking recommended for further accuracy-</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>[[Ishq]], or divine love, is the emphasis of [[Sufism]]. Sufis believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe. God desires to recognize beauty, and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God \"looks\" at itself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is oftentimes referred to as the religion of Love. Allah in Sufism is referred to in three main terms which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved. Allah being called the Beloved is often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through Love humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace.
