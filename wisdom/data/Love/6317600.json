Note that the feeling which Sternberg terms ''passion'' is similar to, if not the same as, that termed ''[[limerence]]'' by [[Dorothy Tennov]]. This last stage may last 10-15 years, until the children grow to the teen age, or longer, depending on cultural and other factors. Sternberg states that a relationship based on a single element is less likely to survive than one based on two or more.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Likewise when a person has known a loved one for a long time, they develop a deeper ''attachment'' to their partner.
