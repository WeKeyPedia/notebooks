The corresponding noun is ''amor'', which is also used in the plural form to indicate 'love affairs' or 'sexual adventures'.  This same root also produces ''amicus'', 'friend', and ''amicitia'', 'friendship' ed on mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to 'indebtedness' or 'influence').
