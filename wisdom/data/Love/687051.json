Plato tells us that love is not completeness but incompleteness. The lack of happiness is love itself. This is the basis of Plato’s famous quote : There is no happy love.

We can desire what we have, what we do, and what exists. It other words, to act, to be joyfull and to rejoice. And this is what refutes platonism. There is the love that we are subjected to, and that is passion ; there is love that we do or give, and that is action. We have friends and we love them. To love is to be able to be happy or to rejoice about something. “There isn’t love but in joy, there isn’t joy but in loving”, Spinoza said. Philia in greek means friendship. Friendship is comparable to a projection of our love for ourselves onto others. It is the joy to love and to be loved. For a couple to continue to desire eachother, that couple must transform their pleasure for passion into joy, gentleness, happiness in being together, into philia. They will pass from a mad love to a wise love. A happy couple is a space of trust, intimacy, reciprocal joy, fidelity, generosity, humour and love. The family is the future of the couple. How could we love if no-one had ever loved us before ? We love our children. We don’t make them to posess them, but we make them knowing they will leave one day. St-Thomas once said : “To love is to want the Good for someone”. (aimer, c’est vouloir du bien à cette personne).

The withdrawing, the gentleness to exists less, to afirm ones self less, the auto-limitation of ones power, that is love, free love, pure love. God doesn’t love us for what we are, but because He is Love. Charity is linked with the lack of Good. It only begins with the friendship-love that we have for God.

This link does not necessarily mean mariage. The love I am talking about represents the feelings one person has towards another without necessarily having the reciprocal. That is the love that permits two persons to really unite in happiness. That feeling is a feeling of well-being when in presence of the person chosen by destiny. It is self-evident that love is not chosen, even if it can be manipulated.  We can distinguish a few ways to fall in love. One of the major ones, that has made lots of ink flow in novels: love at first sight. It can happen at any time of your life as it can also never happen. Love at first sight makes the touched person enter a new world where reason loses it’s sense when in presence of the loved one. He lives only for the other. We can call this passion. It is passion that reanimates the hearts of men when in presence of their loved one, it is that passion that permits us to lift up mountains but also send a man that was happy one day, into a deep interior isolation the next day.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Love is not only positive, it can make us stronger, but it can also destroy or bring down a person. We’ve stoped counting the sucidal cases for love. Love destroys when the reciprocal is not made. The person then falls in a world of fantasms where the loved one is the main actor. He only thinks of her. He dedicates his body and soul to her, hoping to change her heart. The passion appears and becomes bigger and stronger with the refusal of the loved one.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>But what become of the love of the one that has loved so much and that has “succeeded in conquering\". It is not the same anymore, he cannot love in the same way. The so wanted loved one is finally his. The passion diminishes, making place for a sure monotony in the couple formed on fantasms. That passion isn’t the same anymore. The loved one doesn’t become a fantasm anymore because fantasms are dreams about what we desire most. At this point, the quest for another fansasm begins, otherwise the couple could get destroyed by weariness. This it what often happens when two persons love each other enormously. They first live each on their side, seing the other once in a while. But one day, one of them makes the step and asks the other in mariage. At that moment, there is a disruption in the couple, the woman must take care of her husband, must cook him supper, …  She will soon find out that she hadn’t so much work before she got married. Of course this is a dark aspect of mariage, but it represents the evolution of love in a couple.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Love is so strong in men and women that it permits to unite them, to destroy them, to build them up, but it is at the same time so fragile. Especially these days when the “free couple” is more and more a fashion. Youngsters go out more, learn sooner that they can love and take pleasure in the presence of others, but that sort of love is often precarious and is part of our education. Youngsters flirt more easily, taking the risk to hurt someone. They are still unconscious of what love is really about. But we should leave them that way, because they havn’t yet been touched by the effects of the double sided love.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>That fragility of love aslo comes from the fact that we think more and more of ourselves, that we try at any price not to suffer. We don’t necessarily seek the great love like in the past. We are not attracted to that, but we keep our fantasms. These are nourished by all the images the actual mediatic society offers us. But these medias offer us perfection in plastic bodies that we can hardly find in reality. We learn to fantasm on something that we will never have. At this moment, we learn new values from the opposite sex, we try to understand better, we find other qualities that the medias cannot bring us. This love that appears is not passionate love, but a sentimental love. That is where the fragility of that love comes from, the feelings, are able to change in one way or another rapidly.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>To conclude, we are all touched by love one day or another, but never do we learn to handle it.
