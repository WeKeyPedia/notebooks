There is no direct references stating that God is love, but amongst the 99 names of God, there is the name Al-Wadud or \"the Loving One,\" which is found in Surah 11:90 as well as Surah 85:14. It refers Allah as being \"full of loving kindness.\" In Islam, love is more often than not used as an incentive for the sinners to aspire to be as worthy for a God's love as they may. One still has God's love, but how the person evaluate's his own worth is to his own and Allah's own counsel. All who holds the faith has Allah's love, but to what degree or effort has he pleased God depends on the individual itself. -rechecking recommended for further accuracy-</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>====Ishq====</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>====Ishq====</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[Ishq]], or divine love, is the emphasis of [[Sufism]], Sufis believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe.
