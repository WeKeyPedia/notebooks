But you know what sucks more then love, is not being in love. It is better to have loved and lost, then to have never loved at all. Remember that youngster..HAHAHAHA im just screwing with you, love sucks, school sucks, and the world sucks. But hey, lifes a bitch then you die. Kids dont love, you'll only end up heartbroken in a coffin after the girl you thought you \"loved\" cheated on you and her boyfriend put a bullet through the back of your head. Even worse then that though, is when you love, but you are never noticed, just pushed aside like you didnt even exist. Or having your heart stomped on when a girl you love, just gives up.
