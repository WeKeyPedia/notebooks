Similarly, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers 'love' of their cause may be borne not of [[interpersonal love]], but impersonal love coupled with [[altruism]] and strong political convictions. People can also 'love' material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding their identity with that item. In these cases, if sexual passion is actually felt, it is typically considered abnormal or unhealthy, and called [[paraphilia]].</del></div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>----</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Shake that Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy, Laffy taffy.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Religious love==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Religious love==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:27222779:newid:27266546 -->\n",
