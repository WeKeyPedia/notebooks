Consider [[Romeo and Juliet]], [[Othello]], [[Great Expectations]], and other classical and popular works that enumerate how love can lead to tragedy and emotional pain. In human interactions, love becomes a peril when love is not bilateral, known as [[Unrequited love]]. A further peril for individuals that love, or can love others, is that love is not enduring and that many people have psychological [[defense mechanisms]] that inhibit their ability to accept or reciprocate love. One of the most fundamental forms of love is an instructor's love for his or her students (and teaching in general). [[Mr. Waller]] is the classic example.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Human bonding==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Human bonding==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:98415588:newid:98423478 -->\n",
