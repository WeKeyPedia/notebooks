From this verb come ''amans'', a lover, amator, 'professional lover', often with the accessory notion of lechery, and ''amica'', 'girlfriend' in the English sense, often as well being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is ''amor'', which is also used in the plural form to indicate 'love affairs' or 'sexual adventures'. This same root also produces ''amicus'', 'friend', and ''amicitia'', 'friendship' (often based on mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to 'indebtedness' or 'influence'). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia'') which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called ''Ars Amatoria'' (''The Art of Lovers''), which addresses in depth everything from extramarital affairs to overprotective parents.<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">lauren shepherd has no friends</del></div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>''[[Amare]]'' is the basic word for ''to love'', as it still is in Italian today.
