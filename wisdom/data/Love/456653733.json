Human infants and children are for a very long time dependent on parental help. Love have therefore been seen as mechanism to promote mutual parental support of children for an extended time period. Another is that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s may cause, among other effects, permanently reduced [[fertility]], injury to the fetus, and increase risks during [[childbirth]]. This would favor exclusive long-term relationships reducing the risk of contracting a STD.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M.
