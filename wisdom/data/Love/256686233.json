However there is a slight similiarity with male and female hormones. Lust is seen as \"Love\" at first sight, not knowing a person but being sexually attracted to their \"body\" or physical features is most common in man, although Woman is not far behind.

But if you asked those same people if they could decipher and depict the difference between love and lust you just may find yourself without an answer.
