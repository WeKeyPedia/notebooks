These two forces were said to intermingle with the [[four elements]], i.e. earth, water, air, and fire, in such a manner that love, so to say, served as the binding power linking the various parts of existence harmoniously together.   </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div></div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div><ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">Later, [[Plato]] interpreted Empedocles’ two agents as ''attraction'' and ''repulsion'', stating that their operation is conceived in an alternate sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jammer | first = Max  | title = Concepts of Force | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc. | year = 1956 | id = ISBN 0-486-40689-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From these arguments, Plato originated the concept of “likes attract”, e.g. earth is thus attracted towards earth, water toward water, and fire toward fire.  In modern terms this is often phrased in terms of “birds of a feather flock together”.  Later, following developments in electrical theories, such as [[Coulomb's law]], which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed such as \"opposites attract.\"  Over the last century, researcher on the nature of human mating, such as in [[evolutionary psychology]], agree that pairs unite or attract to each other owing to a combination of opposites attract, e.g. people with dissimilar immune systems tend to attract, and likes attract, such similarities of personality, character, views, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berscheid | first = Ellen | coauthors = Walster, Elaine, H.| title = Interpersonal Attraction | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. | year = 1969 | id = CCCN 69-17443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, various human bonding theories have been developed described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and or affinities.</ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>the best couples in the world!</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Religious views==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Religious views==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:99822464:newid:99822545 -->\n",
