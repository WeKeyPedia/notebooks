In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally.

''Ai'' is used as both a verb (e.g. ''wo ai ni'' 我愛你, or \"I love you\") and a noun (such as ''aiqing'' 愛情, or \"romantic love\").  However, due to the influence of Confucian ''Ren'', the phrase ‘Wo ai ni’ (I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty.
