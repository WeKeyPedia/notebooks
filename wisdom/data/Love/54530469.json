Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Famous psychologist Steinberg explains that love has three different components.  Intimacy is a form where two people can share secrets and various details of their personal life.  Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs.  Commitment on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever.  This factor of love is shown in empty love (ex. when two people stay together for the sake of their [[children]]).  The last and most common form of love is simply sex, or passion.  Passionate love is shown in infatuation love, as well as romantic love.
