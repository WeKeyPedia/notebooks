Every text of Scripture should be interpreted along with the norm of love (''DDC'' 1.36.40; 3.10.15), the rule of faith (''regula fidei'', ''DDC'' 2.9.14; ''De Genesi adversus Manicheos'' 1.21.41), and the triad, hope-faith-love (''DDC'' 1.39.43). Love, the criteria in the interpretation of Scripture, should act through and through, because it is the chief purpose of Scripture (''DDC'' 1.35.39). In the last days, every Christian will reach eternity and Scripture will perish, including all scientific hermeneutics (''DDC'' 1.39.43). But “there remain faith, hope, and love, these three; the greatest of these is love” (1 Cor. 13:13). Therefore, although we may be misled in the interpretation of the Bible, we should not miss the target of building up this love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B.
