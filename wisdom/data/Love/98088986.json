It is the subject of considerable debate, enduring speculation, and thoughtful introspection. As an approximation, different aspects of ''love'' can be illustrated by comparing its corollaries and opposites. As a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of ''like''), love is commonly contrasted with [[hate]] (or neutral [[apathy]]); as a less [[selfish|self-centered]] and more \"mutual\" sign of intense desire, love is commonly contrasted with [[lust]]; and as an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is commonly contrasted with [[friendship]], although other connotations of ''love'' may be applied to close friendships as well.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>The diverse range of meanings associated with the English word contrasts with the plurality of [[Greek words for love]], reflecting the depth, versatility, and complexity of the concept.

Some categorically reject the notion as false or meaningless.

Some psychologists maintain that love is the action of lending one's \"boundary\" or \"[[self-esteem]]\" to another.

Expressions of love may include the love for a [[soul]] or [[mind]], the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, love for the respect of others, etc. Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an [[abstraction|abstract]] concept, easier to experience than to explain. Because of the complex and abstract nature of love, discourse on love is commonly reduced to a [[thought-terminating cliché]], and there are a number of common [[proverb]]s regarding love, from Virgil's \"Love conquers all\" to [[The Beatles]]' \"[[All You Need is Love|All you need is love]].\" [[Bertrand Russell]] describes love as a condition of \"absolute value,\" as opposed to [[relative value]].</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Though love is considered a positive and desirable aspect of existence, love can cause a great deal of emotional harm.

In human interactions, love becomes a peril when love is not bilateral, known as [[Unrequited love]]. A further peril for individuals that love, or can love others, is that love is not enduring and that many people have psychological [[defense mechanisms]] that inhibit their ability to accept or reciprocate love.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Human bonding==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Human bonding==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:98088755:newid:98088986 -->\n",
