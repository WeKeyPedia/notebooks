The Free Love movement’s initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, [[birth control]], and [[adultery]]. It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. \"The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism.\" Libertarian Enterprise .19 (1996): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Much of the free-love tradition is an offshoot of [[anarchism]], and reflects a [[Civil libertarianism|civil libertarian]] philosophy that seeks [[freedom (political)|freedom]] from [[State (polity)|state]] regulation and [[Christian Church|church]] interference in [[personal relationship]]s. According to this concept, the [[free union]]s of [[adult]]s are legitimate relations which should be respected by all third parties whether they are emotional or sexual relations. In addition, some free-love writing has argued that both men and women have the right to sexual pleasure. In the [[Victorian era]], this was a radical notion. Later, a new theme developed, linking free love with radical social change, and depicting it as a [[harbinger]] of a new [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]], anti-repressive sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacenews.info/webextras/article.php?id=33 Dan Jakopovich, ''Chains of Marriage'', Peace News]&lt;/ref&gt;</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Many people in the early 19th century believed that marriage was an important aspect of life to \"fulfill earthly human happiness.\" Middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world.

The abrogation of individual rights in marriage is also a concern—for example, some jurisdictions do not recognize [[spousal rape]] or treat it less seriously than non-spousal rape.
