Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive.  Love is essentially an abstract concept, easier to experience than to explain.

Christians, for instance, believe that God Himself is love, that He is an expression of love, and the source of love. They believe that the ultimate expression of love was revealed when God sent His only son Jesus Christ to sacrifice on the cross as the atonement of the sin of all mankind. Mankind thus no longer have to provide animal or ritual sacrifices to God to atone for their sins, but only need to accept Jesus Christ as Savior and confess their sins and ask for forgiveness, fully receiving this offer of love from God.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Types==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Types==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:68104526:newid:68123457 -->\n",
