Specifically, four [[neurotrophin]] levels (NGF, [[BDNF]], [[NT-3]], and [[NT-4]]) of 58 subjects who had recently fallen in love were compared with levels in a control group who were either single or already engaged in a long-term relationship. The results showed that NGF levels were significantly higher in the subjects in love than as compared to either of the control groups.&lt;ref&gt;Emanuele, E.; Polliti, P.; Bianchi, M.; Minoretti, P.; Bertona, M.; &amp; Geroldi, D.

[[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. American psychologist [[Zick Rubin]] seeks to define ''love'' by [[psychometrics]]. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Zick. \"Measurement of Romantic Love.\" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'',16, 265–273, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Zick.

However, in a few unusual and specific domains, such as immune systems, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike themselves (e.g., with an orthogonal immune system), since this will lead to a baby that has the best of both worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berscheid | first = Ellen | coauthors = Walster, Elaine, H.| title = Interpersonal Attraction | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Co | year = 1969 | id = CCCN 69-17443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, various [[human bonding]] theories have been developed, described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and affinities.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Some Western authorities disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic and the narcissistic.

Certainly love is influenced by [[hormone]]s (such as [[oxytocin]]), [[neurotrophins]] (such as [[Nerve Growth Factor|NGF]]), and [[pheromone]]s, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by their conceptions of love.

Attachment between adults is presumed to work on the same principles that lead an infant to become attached to its mother. The traditional psychological view sees love as being a combination of [[companionate love]] and passionate love.

The corresponding noun is ''amor'', which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces ''amicus''—\"friend\"—and ''amicitia'', \"friendship\" (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to \"indebtedness\" or \"influence\"). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia''), which discusses the notion at some length.
