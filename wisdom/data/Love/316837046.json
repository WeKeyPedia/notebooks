The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come ''amans''—a lover, amator, \"professional lover,\" often with the accessory notion of lechery—and ''amica'', \"girlfriend\" in the English sense, often as well being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is ''amor'' (the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City, [[Rome]]—in Latin: ''Roma''—can be viewed as an [[anagram]] for ''amor'', which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, Reden und Schweigen, Munich, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces ''amicus''—\"friend\"—and ''amicitia'', \"friendship\" (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to \"indebtedness\" or \"influence\"). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia''), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called [[Art of Love|''Ars Amatoria'']] (''The Art of Love''), which addresses, in depth, everything from extramarital affairs to overprotective parents.   </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>The Latin language has several different verbs corresponding to the English word \"love.\"  ''Amāre'' is the basic word for ''to love'', as it still is in Italian today.

This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun ''diligentia'', however, has the meaning of \"diligence\" or \"carefulness,\" and has little semantic overlap with the verb. ''[[Observare]]'' is a synonym for ''diligere''; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun, ''observantia'', often denote \"esteem\" or \"affection.\"  ''[[Charity (virtue)|Caritas]]'' is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean \"charitable love\"; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan Roman literature.
