Philosophy aims to rationalize life,but love is a mystery that still puzzles many philosophers. Since humans are self-interested being, it is impossible not to love for reasons. For instance, lovinf someone for his/her beauty is intriguing to philosophers because it is not clear whether beauty is a reason for love or love is why someone seems beautiful. </ins>People, throughout history, have often considered phenomena such as \"[[love at first sight]]\" or \"instant friendships\" to be the result of an uncontrollable [[force]] of attraction or affinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = Helen | title = Why We Love – the Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love | publisher = Henry Holt and Company | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 0-8050-6913-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first to theorize in this direction was the Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]], who in the 4th century BC argued for the existence of two forces, love (''philia'') and strife (''neikos''), which were used to account for the causes of motion in the universe.
