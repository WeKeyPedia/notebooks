[[Attachment theory|Attachment]] is the [[human bonding|bonding]] that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as [[marriage]] and [[children]], or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests.

[[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. American psychologist [[Zick Rubin]] sought to define ''love'' by [[psychometrics]] in the 1970s.

In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally.  Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations.

But that person can \"love\" just one special person, which they call the word \"aşk.\" ''[[Ishq|Aşk]]'' is a feeling for ''to love,'' or being \"in love\" (Aşık), as it still is in Turkish today. The Turks used this word just for their loves in a romantic or sexual sense. If a Turk says that he is in love (Aşık) with somebody, it is not a love that a person can feel for his or her parents; it is just for one person, and it indicates a huge infatuation.

The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come ''amans''—a lover, amator, \"professional lover,\" often with the accessory notion of lechery—and ''amica'', \"girlfriend\" in the English sense, often as well being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is ''amor'' (the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City, [[Rome]]—in Latin: ''Roma''—can be viewed as an [[anagram]] for ''amor'', which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, Reden und Schweigen, Munich, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces ''amicus''—\"friend\"—and ''amicitia'', \"friendship\" (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to \"indebtedness\" or \"influence\"). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia''), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called [[Art of Love|''Ars Amatoria'']] (''The Art of Love''), which addresses, in depth, everything from [[Affair|extramarital affairs]] to overprotective parents.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Complicating the picture somewhat, Latin sometimes uses ''amāre'' where English would simply say ''to like''.

''Diligere'' often has the notion \"to be affectionate for,\" \"to esteem,\" and rarely if ever is used for romantic love. This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun ''diligentia'', however, has the meaning of \"diligence\" or \"carefulness,\" and has little semantic overlap with the verb. ''Observare'' is a synonym for ''diligere''; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun, ''observantia'', often denote \"esteem\" or \"affection.\" ''[[Charity (virtue)|Caritas]]'' is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean \"charitable love\"; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan [[Latin literature|Roman literature]].
