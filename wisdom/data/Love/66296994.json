[[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] created his [[Triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components : Intimacy, Commitment, and Passion.  Intimacy is a form where two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives.  Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs.  Commitment on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever.  The last and most common form of love is simply sex, or passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love.
