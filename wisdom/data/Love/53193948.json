And in contrast to the definition at the top, frequently people use the verb \"love\" to indicate want or desire for themselves as opposed to for another. For example: \"I love ice cream,\" or even \"I love her/him,\" does not refer to desiring wellness for ice cream, and it may not refer to desiring wellness for her/him, but rather to the desire for ice cream or for her/him felt by the speaker. The word also frequently indicates elevated appreciation or admiration: \"I love that artist.\" Love can describe an intense feeling of [[affection]], an [[emotion]] or an emotional state.
