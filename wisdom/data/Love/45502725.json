Religious 'love' might be considered a euphemistic term, more closely describing feelings of deference or [[acquiescence]]. Most religions use the term love to express the [[devotion]] the follower has to their deity, who may be a living [[guru]] or religious teacher, as in the [[Bhakti]] traditions of Asia. This love can be expressed by [[prayer]], service, good deeds, and personal [[sacrifice]]. Reciprocally, the followers may believe that the deity loves the followers and all of creation. Some traditions encourage the development of passionate love in the believer for the deity.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==See also==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==See also==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:45489346:newid:45502725 -->\n",
