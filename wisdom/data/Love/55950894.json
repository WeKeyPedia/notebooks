In the last century, the science of [[psychology]] has written a great deal on the subject.  Recently, however, the sciences of [[evolutionary psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[anthropology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[biology]] have begun to take centre stage in discussion as to the nature and function of love.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Biological models of sex tend to see it as a mammalian drive, just like [[hunger]] or [[thirst]]. Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Famous psychologist Sternberg explains that love has three different components.  Intimacy is a form where two people can share secrets and various details of their personal life.  Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs.  Commitment on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever.  This factor of love is shown in empty love (ex. when two people stay together for the sake of their [[children]]).  The last and most common form of love is simply sex, or passion.  Passionate love is shown in infatuation love, as well as romantic love.  There are probably elements of truth in both views &amp;mdash; certainly love is influenced by [[hormone]]s (such as [[oxytocin]]) and [[pheromone]]s, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by one’s conceptions of love.  Hence, from time immemorial, science, from [[nature|naturalistic]] [[poetry]] to [[MRI]] [[neurochemistry]], has debated the nature of love.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Cultural views==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Cultural views==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:55950815:newid:55950894 -->\n",
