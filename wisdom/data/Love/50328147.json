How do we know?  Because people are moved and changed by it.  It keeps things alive, and without it, they die.  It makes them grow, and without it, they are stunted.  It is the most inspiring force on earth -- the desire to love and be loved.  It is a nutrient for the heart, and every other part of a living being.  Everything that lives responds to love and rejoices when in union with it.  It is also an eternal substance that once created, can never die, even though it may go into a sleep state, it can always be reawakened, as the Spring. It has its own language and expresses itself in poetic mysteries, ubiquitous to all things, for those who can find it. It is a fire that combusts within a person and grows from that explosion, a body of love, an essence, mist, or flame, that cannot dwell alone.\"  (by Sevi Regis, from the novel, SoulSongs.)</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>The concept of love, however, is subject to debate.
