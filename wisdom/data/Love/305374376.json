As for the latter, one is commanded to love God \"with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might\" ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:5), taken by the [[Mishnah]] (a central text of the Jewish [[oral law]]) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all of one's possessions, and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5). [[Rabbinic literature]] differs as to how this love can be developed, e.g., by contemplating divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature.  As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: \"See life with the wife you love\" ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:9). The biblical book [[Song of Solomon]] is considered a romantically phrased metaphor of love between God and his people, but in its plain reading, reads like a love song.   </ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>    </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>[[Judaism]] employs a wide definition of love, both among people and between man and the Deity.
