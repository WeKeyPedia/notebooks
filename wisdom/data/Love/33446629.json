I say only this, that once love has taken you over - and I mean controlled you in ways you thought impossible, made you do things you thought you would never do, go places you would never go, and feel things you believed beyond belief people didn't feel - then there can be no understanding of love. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>   Inasmuch as many people do associate love with religion I must say I respect that in some way. But ultimately love is the most intensely personal emotion on the planet. No matter what anyone says about it or how anyone tries to explain it to you, you just have to feel your heart beating outside of your body to truly comprehend the magnitude of such a thing. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>   In the very end, love is basically the most beautiful thing one can experience. Once you feel that you have gone as far as man can go in beauty - that you have traveled to the ends of ecstasy and love cannot take you any further - love just does take you further. It is the feeling of perfection and then somehow greater perfection. Consider the thought that love is infinite but that somehow on the outside of infinity there is only more and greater infinity. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>   It may be that someone, somewhere, sometime is going to need some perspective and come here to read this. They will come and try to see what love is, what true passion really means. I will say listen to your heart. Better yet, listen to your breathing. See if you can breathe without that person - that something - you love. See if you can breathe without whom or what or where you love. If you are left gasping for breath at the thought then there is no reason to look further.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>    If it passes like most things do then enjoy the moment and keep looking further.
