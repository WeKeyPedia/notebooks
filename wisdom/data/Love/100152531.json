It is the subject of considerable debate, enduring speculation, and thoughtful introspection. As an approximation, different aspects of ''love'' can be illustrated by comparing its corollaries and opposites. As a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of ''like''), love is commonly contrasted with [[hate]] (or neutral [[apathy]]); as a less [[selfish|self-centered]] and more \"mutual\" sign of intense desire, love is commonly contrasted with [[lust]]; and as an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is commonly contrasted with [[friendship]], although other connotations</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>&lt;br/&gt;of ''love'' may be applied to close friendships as well.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>The diverse range of meanings associated with the English word contrasts with the plurality of [[Greek words for love]], reflecting the depth, versatility, and complexity of the concept. This diversity of meanings is reflected in the many distinct classifications of love including [[romantic love]]; [[human sexuality|sexual]] desire; [[platonic love]]; [[love (religious views)|religious love]]; [[familial love]]; [[true love]]; and the more casual application of the term to anything pleasurable, enjoyable, desirable, or preferred, including activities and favorite foods.&lt;ref name=\"IdiomNote\"&gt;Casual application of the word \"love\" also includes [[idiom]]atic expressions and uses with differing connotations.

Love often involves caring for or identifying with a person or thing, including oneself (cf. [[narcissism]]).In this use, love is actually the greatest proportion on selfishness, in that one only wants one thing, and that is for another being to be happy, and the one in love will do anything to fulfill this wish. This case however, does not necessarily end in marriage, because another may make the loved one happier, meaning the lover will give the other up.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>The very existence of love is itself subject to debate. Some categorically reject the notion as false or meaningless. Others call it a recently-invented abstraction, sometimes dating the \"invention\" to courtly Europe during or after the middle ages, although this is contradicted by the sizable body of ancient love poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.TrueOpenLove.org/reference/AncientLovePoetry.html Ancient Love Poetry] - TrueOpenLove.org&lt;/ref&gt; Others maintain that love really exists, and is not an abstraction, but is undefinable, being an essence which is [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] in nature. Some psychologists maintain that love is the action of lending one's \"boundary\" or \"[[self-esteem]]\" to another.

Expressions of love may include the love for a [[soul]] or [[mind]], the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, love for the respect of others, etc. Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an [[abstraction|abstract]] concept, easier to experience than to explain. Because of the complex and abstract nature of love, discourse on love is commonly reduced to a [[thought-terminating cliché]], and there are a number of common [[proverb]]s regarding love, from Virgil's \"Love conquers all\" to [[The Beatles]]' \"[[All You Need is Love|All you need is love]].\" [[Bertrand Russell]] describes love as a condition of \"absolute value,\" as opposed to [[relative value]].</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Human bonding==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Human bonding==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:100131956:newid:100152531 -->\n",
