Solomon suggests that though many beleive that love is \"subjective,\" the reasons for love do not only depend on perspective, but also on the relationship between the lover and the beloved.

[[Robert Anson Heinlein]], one of the most prolific science fiction writers of the 20th century, defined love in his novel ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' as the point of emotional connection which leads to the happiness of another being essential to one's own well being. This definition ignores the ideas of religion and science and instead focuses on the meaning of love as it relates to the individual.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 84:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 81:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[Image:Love-zh.png|180px|thumb|The traditional [[Chinese character]] for love (愛) consists of a [[heart]] (心, in the middle) inside of \"accept\", \"feel\", or \"perceive\", which shows a graceful emotion.]]</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[Image:Love-zh.png|180px|thumb|The traditional [[Chinese character]] for love (愛) consists of a [[heart]] (心, in the middle) inside of \"accept\", \"feel\", or \"perceive\", which shows a graceful emotion.]]</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Although there exist numerous cross-cultural unified similarities as to the nature and definition of love, as in there being a thread of commitment, tenderness, and passion common to all human existence, there are differences. <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">The</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">trend of love marriages started</del> in <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">the 1970s</del> and <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">1980s but has had a significant implact on a large population</del> of <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">the</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">world.</del>  <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">Though</del> marriages <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">are traditionally arranged for purposes such as convention</del>, <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">honor</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">of</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">the</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">family, and family relations with others, marriages based on</del> love <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">are</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">becoming</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">more</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">and</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">more</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">popular.</del>  <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">The</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">ideas</del> of<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> dating before</del> marriage <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">and</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">love as a prerequisite for marraige</del> is <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">a</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">Western</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">ideas</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">that</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">are</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">exported to</del> the <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">East,</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">among</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">others</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">things.</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> Young Indians</del>, <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">for</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">example</del>,<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> reported that 10% to 20% for their friends are involved in</del> love<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> marriages.
