I John 4:8 states \"God is Love\".  In essence, God is the epitomy of love - in action and relation.  It is God that first loved mankind and desired a relationship. (John 3:16-17)  Love is the underlying drive in most people.  The search for love seems endless within the human race, throughout the ages.  The Bible defines God as being the completeness of love.  Love, as being defined by him, is demonstrated in his character and personality. Another way of defining this type of love is \"godly love\", a love shown through the example of Christ's sacrifice on the cross. However, this \"sacrificial\" love can also be expressed by humans. For example, the love of a mother for her child. It is one one of the strongest bonds of love known to Man. The mother would sacrifice anything for the child. It is this type of love that the Bible teaches us to follow and to share with one another. Love, in the end, is truly a sacrifice. See The Bible for further details.</ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Also as science defines Love: {{cquote|Love is the cognitive affective state, characterized by intrusive and obsessive fantasizing, concerning reciprocity of amorant feelings, with the subject of amorance.}}</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>This means that in a relationship, both male and female are expected to love one another mutually. In a mutual relationship both partners benefit, not one partner giving and the other only receiving. No! This love involves intellectual reasoning which can be worrisome at times. But through the mental processes the \"him/her\" fantasizes each other's love, which helps them stay in love. The bible says, that LOVE is a gift of GOD. Therefore, such as gift from God should be used wisely. Where am I going with this? Well, as we look around in our society, we can see that there is more hatred than love. This cause disunity among individuals. And so, there are higher divorce rates than ever before because of a lacking factor, there is no LOVE. Furthermore, the first fruit of the spirit is LOVE, as we all know it. Therefore, we need to LOVE more.(Galatians 5:22)OEB.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Cultural views==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Cultural views==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:100125621:newid:100126140 -->\n",
