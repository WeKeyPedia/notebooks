I think gay people should go and not be gay. Gay guys should care less about shopping and care more about girls. Gay love is in the heart though. We just need to give them new hearts to fix this. I think the president should not let gay people get married. To all those gay people that are reading this. F*ck You Mother Truckas!!!!

It is a more potent sentiment than a simple ''liking'' for another. [[Unrequited love]] refers to those feelings of love which are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with [[interpersonal relationships]]. Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples.

In many religions and systems of ethics it is considered wrong to act on sexual desire for immediate family, for children, or outside of a committed relationship. However, there are many ways to express passionate love without sex.
