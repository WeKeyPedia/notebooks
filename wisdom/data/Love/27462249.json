It is a more potent sentiment than a simple ''liking'' for another. [[Unrequited love]] refers to those feelings of love which are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with [[interpersonal relationships]]. Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples.

While sexual attraction often establishes a new bond, sexual intention is considered undesirable or inappropriate in certain love bonds. In many religions and systems of ethics it is considered wrong to act on sexual desire for immediate family, for children, or outside of a committed relationship. However, there are many ways to express passionate love without sex.  Affection, emotional intimacy and shared interests are common in friendships and kinships of all human beings.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Impersonal love==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Impersonal love==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:27435851:newid:27462249 -->\n",
