[[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: Intimacy, Commitment, and Passion. ''Intimacy'' is a form by which two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives. Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. This led researchers such as Yela{{Fact|date=February 2007}} to further refine the model by separating Passion into two independents components: Erotic Passion and Romantic Passion.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Following developments in electrical theories, such as [[Coulomb's law]], which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed, such as \"opposites attract\". Over the last century, research on the nature of human mating, such as in [[evolutionary psychology]], agree that pairs unite or attract to each other owing to a combination of opposites attract, e.g. people with dissimilar immune systems tend to attract, and likes attract, such as similarities of personality, character, views, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berscheid | first = Ellen | coauthors = Walster, Elaine, H.| title = Interpersonal Attraction | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. | year = 1969 | id = CCCN 69-17443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, various [[human bonding]] theories have been developed described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and or affinities.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Some Western authorities  disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic and the narcissistic.
