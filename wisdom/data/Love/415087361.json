[[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. American psychologist Zick Rubin seeks to define ''love'' by [[psychometrics]]. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon.
