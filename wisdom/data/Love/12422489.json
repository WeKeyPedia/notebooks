Generally love will start off in the ''lust'' phase, strong in passion but weak in the other elements. The primary motivator at this stage is the basic sexual instinct. Appearance, smells and other similar factors play a decisive role in screening potential mates. However, as time passes, the other elements may grow and passion may shrink &amp;mdash; this depends upon the individual. So what starts as Infatuation or Empty love may well develop into one of the fuller types of love. At the ''attraction'' stage the person concentrates their affection on a single mate and fidelity becomes important.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Likewise when a person has known a loved one for a long time, they develop a deeper attachment to their partner.
