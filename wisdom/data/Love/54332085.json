Now that these two have been together so long things seem to be getting harder, as love takes its toll on things. such as when you love someone and they do something small it is mainly always blown out or propotion. if the love is real then by all means the two who are 'in love' will do anything to over come these problems. once the problem reaches its maximum then the couple has to sit down and work out what happens next. in some cases it is one of the two who makes the ultimate decision and in the case of gem and mike this will be the decision made on the 21st May 2006... mike can only wait and hope now...</del></div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div><ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">{{otheruses}}</ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>[[Image:Love heart uidaodjsdsew.gif|200px|thumb|right|A [[cartoonish]] version of the [[Heart (symbol)|heart]], a frequent modern symbol of love.]]</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Love is an emotion of intense attraction to, care for, or identification with persons, place(s) or thing(s); a desire to be close to, move and construct its object.

For example: \"I love ice cream,\" or even \"I love her/him,\" does not refer to desiring wellness for ice cream, and it may not refer to desiring wellness for her/him, but rather to the desire for ice cream or for her/him felt by the speaker.
