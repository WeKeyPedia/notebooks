This diversity of meanings is reflected in the many distinct classifications of love including [[romantic love]]; [[human sexuality|sexual]] desire; [[platonic love]]; [[love (religious views)|religious love]]; [[familial love]]; [[true love]]; and the more casual application of the term to anything pleasurable, enjoyable, desirable, or preferred, including activities and favorite foods.&lt;ref name=\"IdiomNote\"&gt;</del>Casual application of the word \"love\" also includes [[idiom]]atic expressions and uses with differing connotations.
