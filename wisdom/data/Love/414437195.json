Within this framework, love becomes one element in the process. Companies analyze the [[Homo sapiens|human being]] and search for the best way to extract from him the highest amount of consumption, not hesitating to use love and sex in a denatured and grotesque way: the company invokes love feelings and desire, but the final purpose is not to search for love and sex in the consumer, but his money and work. As a consequence, there's dehumanization when love to another human being is identified with love to a product, since that association brings, inevitably, the identification of the human being with a product. [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] also consider that capitalism kills the concepts of body and soul.&lt;ref name=\"Deleuze\"&gt;Gilles Deleuze. Félix Guattari.

A \"flesh emancipation\" process followed, which started with shy attempts and continued, with [[trobadour]]s, with a period of accented sensuality, of development of free and naive love. Lastly, came a stage of great refinement and, as a coda, moral laxity and perversion.&lt;ref name=\"Sombart\"&gt;Werner Sombart.
