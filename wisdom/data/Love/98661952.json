Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. [[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[Triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: Intimacy, Commitment, and Passion. ''Intimacy'' is a form by which two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives.  Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. ''Commitment'' on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. ''Passionate'' love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. This led researchers such as Yela {{fact}} to further refine the model by separating Passion into two independents components: Erotic Passion and Romantic Passion.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Biological models of sex tend to view love as a [[mammal]]ian drive, just like [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].
