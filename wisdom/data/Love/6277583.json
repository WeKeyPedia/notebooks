According to current scientific understanding of love, this transition from attraction to attachment phase usually happens in about 30 months.

Note that the feeling which Sternberg terms ''passion'' is similar to, if not the same as, that termed ''[[limerence]]'' by [[Dorothy Tennov]]. This last stage may last 10-15 years, until the children grow to the teen age, or longer, depending on cultural and other factors. Sternberg states that a relationship based on a single element is less likely to survive than one based on two or more.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Likewise when a person has known a loved one for a long time, <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">they</ins> <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">develop</ins> a deeper ''attachment'' to <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">their</ins> partner.
