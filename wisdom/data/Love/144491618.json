[[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], a leading expert in the topic of love, divides the experience of love into three partly-overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment.  Lust exposes people to others, romantic attraction encourages people to focus their energy on mating, and attachment involves tolerating the spouse long enough to rear a child into infancy. </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>[[Lust]] is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes [[mating]], and involves the increased release of chemicals such as [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months. [[Interpersonal attraction|Attraction]] is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. Recent studies in [[neuroscience]] have indicated that as people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including [[pheromones]], [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]], which act similar to [[amphetamine]]s, stimulating the brain's [[pleasure center]] and leading to side-effects such as an increased [[heart rate]], loss of appetite and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half to three years.&lt;ref name=\"human\"&gt;Winston, Robert (2004). ''Human''.

[[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: Intimacy, Commitment, and Passion. ''Intimacy'' is a form by which two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives. Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. This led researchers such as Yela{{Fact|date=February 2007}} to further refine the model by separating Passion into two independents components: Erotic Passion and Romantic Passion.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Following developments in electrical theories, such as [[Coulomb's law]], which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed, such as \"opposites attract\".
