Expressions of love may include the love for a [[soul]] or [[mind]], the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, love for the respect of others, etc. Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an [[abstraction|abstract]] concept, easier to experience than to explain. Because of the complex and abstract nature of love, discourse on love is commonly reduced to a [[thought-terminating cliché]], and there are a number of common [[proverb]]s regarding love, from Virgil's \"Love conquers all\" to [[The Beatles]]' \"[[All You Need is Love|All you need is love]]\".

In human interactions, love becomes a peril when love is not bilateral, known as [[Unrequited love]].

Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. [[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] created his [[Triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: Intimacy, Commitment, and Passion. Intimacy is a form where two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives.  Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is simply sex, or passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. This led researchers such as Yela to further refine the model by separating Passion into two independents components: Erotic Passion and Romantic Passion.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>===Chemical basis===</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Recent studies in [[neuroscience]] have indicated that a consistent number of chemicals are present in the brain when people testify to feeling love.

More specifically, higher levels of Testosterone and Oestrogen are present during the lustful phase of a relationship.
