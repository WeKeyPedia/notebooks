[[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion.

Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components.
