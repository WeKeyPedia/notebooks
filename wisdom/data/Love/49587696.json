The existence of love is, however, an inherently dissolute concept, and it is possible to, instead of viewing love as an act between two subjects, to instead note that in all amorous relations there must be a subject and an object. This has been both compared to patriarchal relations, and non-compared (or rather viewed as a patriarchal relation in its own performative field).</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>The performativity of love has been viewed as a supplement to a [[paradoxistential]] variety of living, if in this case, living is not in fact living, in the sense of living as an act or state, but rather living as an identity, or the view of being a living person as an aspect of a person's identity, separating the living, loving, person from the person that identifies themselves as dead. Love relates to this in the sense that it is, in some ways, a hegemony of living, which, via the Marxian channel of [[analysis]], convincerates human beings that there is a non-reproductive [[incentive]] to reproduce, and, in this sense, the expression of love has been likened to a performative utterance of [[reproduction]], or at least a semi-act which prededes the foutological stage, which is the act, not only of creating more living persons, but distributing the identity of living. </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Thus, love has been treated, by many contemporary masters of suspicion, as both a hegemony that compels the '[[sex]] [[proletariat]]' (to be distinguished from [[sex workers]] by the fact that it includes every [[heterosexual]] person following traditional [[gender roles]] and every homosexual person, especially lesbians, that has been trapped in the anti-[[nihilist]] hegemony) into unneccessary, and often straining, [[cultural]] work, and as a form of [[imperialism]] which perpetuates and globalises the identity of the living, and segregates persons that identify themselves as dead (or are identified as dead by societal impostitions) within cemeteries and mythic pedestals.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Overview ==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Overview ==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:49582879:newid:49587696 -->\n",
