Love can be better described by studying it's charactiristics. If one looks at the word of God or the Bible, love is charictirized as follows: 1Co 13:4-8  Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant  (5)  or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;  (6)  it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.  (7)  Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.  (8)  Love never ends. In other words it is all about having certian attributes, and also bieng able and allow God to change you and me to recieve these attributes.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>If love had anything to do with emotion it will mean because emotions change, you and my love will change from warm to cold constantly.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==See also==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==See also==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 98:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 95:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>*[http://www.zaadz.com/quotes/topics/love Quotes about Love]</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>*[http://www.zaadz.com/quotes/topics/love Quotes about Love]</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>*[http://www.mysterymethod.com/ Mystery Method]</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>*[http://www.mysterymethod.com/ Mystery Method]</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>The Holy Bible- God</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[Category:Love| ]]</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[Category:Love| ]]</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:45123881:newid:45123993 -->\n",
