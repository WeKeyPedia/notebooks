In modern terms this is often phrased in terms of “birds of a feather flock together”.  Later, following developments in electrical theories, such as [[Coulomb's law]], which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed such as \"opposites attract.\"  Over the last century, researcher on the nature of human mating, such as in [[evolutionary psychology]], agree that pairs unite or attract to each other owing to a combination of opposites attract, e.g. people with dissimilar immune systems tend to attract, and likes attract, such similarities of personality, character, views, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berscheid | first = Ellen | coauthors = Walster, Elaine, H.| title = Interpersonal Attraction | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. | year = 1969 | id = CCCN 69-17443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, various human bonding theories have been developed described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and or affinities.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>==Religious views==</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>{{main|Love (religious views)}}</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Love in early religions was a mixture of ecstatic devotion and ritualised obligation to idealised natural forces (pagan polytheism).

Love, as being defined by him, is demonstrated in his character and personality. Another way of defining this type of love is \"godly love\", a love shown through the example of Christ's sacrifice on the cross. However, this \"sacrificial\" love can also be expressed by humans. For example, the love of a mother for her child. It is one one of the strongest bonds of love known to Man. The mother would sacrifice anything for the child.

''Intimacy'' is a form by which two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives.  Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. ''Commitment'' on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion.
