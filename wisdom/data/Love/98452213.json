''Intimacy'' is a form by which two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives.  Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. ''Commitment'' on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. ''Passionate'' love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love.
