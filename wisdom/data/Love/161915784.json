The difficulty of finding a universal definition for love is typically tackled by classifying it into types, such as passionate love, romantic love, and committed love.  These types of love can often be generalized into a level of sexual attraction. In common use, ''love'' has two primary meanings, the first being an indication of adoration for another person or thing, and the second being a state of relational status. Love is an act of identifying with a person or thing, capable of even including oneself (cf. [[narcissism]]; [[reverence]]).

''Intimacy'' is a form by which two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives. Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion.

Love, as being defined by Him, is demonstrated in his character and personality. Another way of defining this type of love is \"godly love\", a love shown through the example of Christ's sacrifice on the cross. However, this \"sacrificial\" love can also be expressed by humans, although imperfectly. For example, the love of a mother for her child. Many mothers would sacrifice anything for their children. It is this type of love that the Bible teaches us to follow and to share with one another. Love, in the end, is truly a sacrifice, ultimately expressed in the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]] as described in the [[New Testament]].  C.S.
