Generally love will start off strong in passion but weak in the other elements.  However as time passes, the other elements may grow and passion may shrink -- this depends upon the individual.  So what starts as Infatuation or Empty love may well develop into one of the fuller types of love.  Likewise when a person has known a loved one for a long time, passion may fade, changing love from Consummate to Companionate, or from Romantic love to Liking.  Note that the feeling which Sternberg terms ''passion'' is similar to, if not the same as, that termed ''[[limerence]]'' by [[Dorothy Tennov]]. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Religious views ==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Religious views ==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:1867599:newid:1867628 -->\n",
