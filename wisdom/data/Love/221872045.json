A person can love the god, a person, the parents or the family. But that person can \"love\" just one person from the opposite sex which they call the word \"ask\". ''[[Ishq|Ask]]'' is a feeling for ''to love'', as it still is in Turkish today. The Turks used this word just for their romantic loves in a romantic or sexual sense. If a Turk says that he is in love (ask) with somebody, it is not a love that a person can feel for his or her parents; it is just for one person and it indicates a huge infatuation.</ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>In Turkish the word \"Love\" comes up with several meanings.
