Lovemaps help to explain why people like what they like sexuoerotically, such as [[necrophilia]], [[coprophilia]], or [[masochism]], etc. According to Money, a lovemap is \"a developmental representation or template in the mind and in the brain depicting the idealized lover and the idealized program of sexuoerotic activity projected in imagery or actually engaged in with that lover.\" Although the concept of \"lovemaps\" originally focused on atypical love, it has since been referenced in discussions on typical love.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Triangular theory of love===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Triangular theory of love===</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:42627599:newid:42636554 -->\n",
