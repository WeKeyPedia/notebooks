In the last century, the science of [[psychology]] has written a great deal on the subject.

Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. There are probably elements of truth in both views &amp;mdash; certainly love is influenced by [[hormone]]s (such as [[oxytocin]]) and [[pheromone]]s, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by one’s conceptions of love.  Hence, from time immemorial, science, from [[nature|naturalistic]] [[poetry]] to [[MRI]] [[neurochemistry]], has since debated over the nature of love.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Cultural views==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Cultural views==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:46349030:newid:46349133 -->\n",
