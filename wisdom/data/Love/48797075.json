It can describe an intense feeling of [[affection]], an [[emotion]] or an emotional state. In ordinary use, it usually refers to interpersonal love.  And what is usually felt by a person for another person, and is usually impossible to describe. Dictionaries tend to define ''love'' as deep affection or fondness.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated American Dictionary'' (1998) + ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  In colloquial use, according to polled opinion, the most favored definitions of ''love'' include the words:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanthermodynamics.com/RP2-Love.html '04 Poll of 250 Chicagoans] – Institute of Human Thermodynamics (Chicago)&lt;/ref&gt; </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>#'''[[life]]''' - someone or something for which you would give your life.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>#'''[[care]]''' - someone or something about which you care more than yourself.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>#'''[[friendship]]''' - favored interpersonal associations or relationships.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>#'''[[human bonding|union]]''' - a synergistic connection, as in the perfect union of two souls.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>#'''[[family]]''' - people related via common ancestry, religion, or race, etc.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>The concept of love, however, is subject to debate.

Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an abstract concept, easier to experience than to explain.
