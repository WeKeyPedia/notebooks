However, due to the influence of Confucian ''Ren'', the phrase ‘Wo ai ni’ (I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying ‘Wo ai ni’ as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a different way.
