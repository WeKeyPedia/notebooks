Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of \"universal love\" (''jiān'ài'', 兼愛). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally.  Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations.  Later in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the term ''Ai'' (愛) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, ''Ai'' was seen as capable or being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>The concept of ''Ai'' (愛) was developed by the Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]] in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love.
