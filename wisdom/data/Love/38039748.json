Similarly, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' 'love' of their cause may be born not of [[interpersonal love]], but impersonal love coupled with [[altruism]] and strong political convictions.  People can also 'love' material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding their identity with that item. (ex: \"I love cheese.\") In some cases there may be an erotic component to such feeling of love. If that desire reaches the point of being acted out, it may be considered unhealthy, and fall under the category of [[paraphilia]].</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Religious love==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Religious love==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:38039644:newid:38039748 -->\n",
