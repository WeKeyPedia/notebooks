The corresponding noun is ''amor'', which is also used in the plural form to indicate 'love affairs' or 'sexual adventures'. This same root also produces ''amicus'', 'friend', and ''amicitia'', 'friendship' (often based on mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to 'indebtedness' or 'influence'). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia'') which discusses the notion at some length.
