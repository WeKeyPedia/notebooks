The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come ''amans''—a lover, amator, \"professional lover,\" often with the accessory notion of lechery—and ''amica'', \"girlfriend\" in the English sense, often as well being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is ''amor'', which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces ''amicus''—\"friend\"—and ''amicitia'', \"friendship\" (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to \"indebtedness\" or \"influence\"). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia''), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called [[Art of Love|''Ars Amatoria'']] (''The Art of Love''), which addresses, in depth, everything from extramarital affairs to overprotective parents.</ins>   </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>    </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>    </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>''<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">Amāre</del>'' <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">is</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">the</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">basic</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">word</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">for</del> ''to <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">love</del>''<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">,</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">as</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">it</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">still</del> is <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">in</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">Italian</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">today.</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">The</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">Romans</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">used</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">it</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">both</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">in</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">an</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">affectionate</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">sense</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">as</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">well</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">as</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">in</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">a</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">romantic</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">or</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">sexual</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">sense.</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">From</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">this</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">verb</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">come</del> ''<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">amans</del>''<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">—a</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">lover,</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">amator,</del> \"<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">professional</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">lover</del>,\" <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">often</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">with</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">the</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">accessory</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">notion</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">of</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">lechery—and</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">''amica'',</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">\"girlfriend\"</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">in</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">the</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">English</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">sense,</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">often</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">as</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">well</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">being</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">applied</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">euphemistically</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">to</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">a</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">prostitute</del>.
