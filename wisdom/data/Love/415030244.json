Within this framework, love becomes one element in the process. Companies analyze the [[Homo sapiens|human being]] and search for the best way to extract from him the highest amount of consumption, not hesitating to use love and sex in a denatured and grotesque way: companies invoke love feelings and desire, but their final purpose is not to search for love and sex in the consumer, but his money and work. As a consequence, there's dehumanization when love to another human being is identified with love to a product, since that association brings, inevitably, the identification of the human being with a product.

A \"flesh emancipation\" process followed, which started with shy attempts and continued, with [[trobadour]]s, with a period of accented sensuality, of free and naive love development.
