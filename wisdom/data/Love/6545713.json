As for the former, the [[Torah]] states: \"Love your neighbor like yourself\" ([[Leviticus]] 19:18). As for the latter, one is commanded to love God \"with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your possessions\" ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:5), taken by the [[Mishnah]] (a central text of the Jewish [[oral law]]) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all one's possessions and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5). [[Rabbinic literature]] differs how this love can be developed, e.g. by contemplating Divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature. As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: \"See life with the wife you love\" ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:9). The Biblical book [[Song of Solomon|Song of Songs]] is a considered a romantically-phrased metaphor of love between God and his people, but in its plain reading reads like a love song. The 20th century Rabbi [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] is frequenly quoted as defining love from the Jewish point-of-view as \"giving without expecting to take\" (from his ''Michtav me-Eliyahu'', vol. 1). Romantic love ''per se'' has few echoes in Jewish literature, although the Medieval Rabbi [[Judah Halevi]] wrote romantic poetry in Arabic in his younger years (also he appears to have regretted this later).</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[Judaism]] employs a wide definition of love, both between people and between man and the Deity.
