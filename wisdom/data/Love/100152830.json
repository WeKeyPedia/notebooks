Love often involves caring for or identifying with a person or thing, including oneself (cf. [[narcissism]]).In this use, love is actually the greatest proportion on selfishness, in that one only wants one thing, and that is for another being to be happy, and the one in love will do anything to fulfill this wish. This case however, does not necessarily end in marriage, because another may make the loved one happier, meaning the lover will give the other up</ins>.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>The very existence of love is itself subject to debate. Some categorically reject the notion as false or meaningless.

Some psychologists maintain that love is the action of lending one's \"boundary\" or \"[[self-esteem]]\" to another.

Expressions of love may include the love for a [[soul]] or [[mind]], the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, love for the respect of others, etc. Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an [[abstraction|abstract]] concept, easier to experience than to explain. Because of the complex and abstract nature of love, discourse on love is commonly reduced to a [[thought-terminating cliché]], and there are a number of common [[proverb]]s regarding love, from Virgil's \"Love conquers all\" to [[The Beatles]]' \"[[All You Need is Love|All you need is love]].\" [[Bertrand Russell]] describes love as a condition of \"absolute value,\" as opposed to [[relative value]].</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>==Human bonding==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>{{main|Human bonding}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>People, throughout history, have often considered phenomena such as “love at first sight” or “instant friendships” to be the result of an uncontrollable [[force]] of attraction or affinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = Helen | title = Why We Love – the Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love | publisher = Henry Holt and Company | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 0-8050-6913-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first to theorize in this direction was the Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]] who in the fourth century BC argued for existence of two forces: love (''philia'') and strife (''neikos''), which were used to account for the causes of motion in the universe.  These two forces were said to intermingle with the [[four elements]], i.e. earth, water, air, and fire, in such a manner that love, so to say, served as the binding power linking the various parts of existence harmoniously together.   </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Later, [[Plato]] interpreted Empedocles’ two agents as ''attraction'' and ''repulsion'', stating that their operation is conceived in an alternate sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jammer | first = Max  | title = Concepts of Force | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc. | year = 1956 | id = ISBN 0-486-40689-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From these arguments, Plato originated the concept of “likes attract”, e.g. earth is thus attracted towards earth, water toward water, and fire toward fire.  In modern terms this is often phrased in terms of “birds of a feather flock together”.  Later, following developments in electrical theories, such as [[Coulomb's law]], which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed such as \"opposites attract.\"  Over the last century, researcher on the nature of human mating, such as in [[evolutionary psychology]], agree that pairs unite or attract to each other owing to a combination of opposites attract, e.g. people with dissimilar immune systems tend to attract, and likes attract, such similarities of personality, character, views, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berscheid | first = Ellen | coauthors = Walster, Elaine, H.| title = Interpersonal Attraction | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. | year = 1969 | id = CCCN 69-17443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, various human bonding theories have been developed described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and or affinities.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Religious views==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Religious views==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:100152705:newid:100152830 -->\n",
