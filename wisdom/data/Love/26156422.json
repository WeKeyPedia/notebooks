Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself.

From this verb come ''amans'', a lover, amator, 'professional lover', often with the accessory notion of lechery, and ''amica'', 'girlfriend' in the English sense, often as well being applied euphemistically to a prostitute.  The corresponding noun is ''amor'', which is also used in the plural form to indicate 'love affairs' or 'sexual adventures'.  This same root also produces ''amicus'', 'friend', and ''amicitia'', 'friendship' (often based on mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to 'indebtedness' or 'influence').  Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia'') which discusses the notion at some length.

Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is oftentimes referred to as the religion of Love. God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through Love humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace.
