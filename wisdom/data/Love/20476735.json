From this verb come 'amans', a lover, amator, a 'professional lover', often with the accessory notion of lechery, and 'amica', 'girlfriend' in the English sense, often as well being applied euphemistically to a prostitute.  The corresponding noun is 'amor', which is also used in the plural form to indicate 'love affairs' or 'sexual adventures'.  This same root also produces 'amicus' 'friend' and 'amicitia' 'friendship (often based on mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to 'indebtedness' or 'influence').
