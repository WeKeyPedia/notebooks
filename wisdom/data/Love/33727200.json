To love a person is to unconditionally give yourself to that person, despite any suffering they may cause you.  For the best example of this kind of love, see Shel Silverstein's [[The Giving Tree]].  Any cultural distinction given to the word \"love,\" as enumerated below in this article, falls under this definition.  This definition of love is also known to have been watered down into \"types\" or \"categories\" because of a perpetual confusion of love with emotion, affection, sexual urges, and, in particular, all and any manifestation of desire.  It may also be due to the immensely painful state of vulnerability and responsibility involved with this decision, forcing many to fabricate an easier, less painful definition.  (see [[Rilke]])  But essentially, it is a choice, whose truest and purest form emanates from its basis upon what is referred to as intuition, instinct, gut-feeling, the heart, or the voice of God.  In this way, it is truly selfess, timeless, and unbreakable because the choice is borne out of something beyond one's temporal and transient self.  </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Love is inherent in all human cultures.
