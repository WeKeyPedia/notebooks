After the review of Christian doctrine, Augustine treats the problem of love in terms of use and enjoyment until the end of Book I of ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (1.22.21-1.40.44; [hereafter ''DDC'']). Many questions about love of neighbors, self-love, love of God, using or enjoying human beings, and God’s using of us, are dealt with. The duplex commandment of love is the fulfillment and end of the law and thus the core of Christian faith and Scripture (''DDC'' 1.26.27; 1.35.39). One should love God the most, and should love other things for God’s sake. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Augustine did not interpret the Bible without any presupposition. Every text of Scripture should be interpreted along with the norm of love (''DDC'' 1.36.40; 3.10.15), the rule of faith (''regula fidei'', ''DDC'' 2.9.14; ''De Genesi adversus Manicheos'' 1.21.41), and the triad, hope-faith-love (''DDC'' 1.39.43). Love, the criteria in the interpretation of Scripture, should act through and through, because it is the chief purpose of Scripture (''DDC'' 1.35.39). In the last days, every Christian will reach eternity and Scripture will perish, including all scientific hermeneutics (''DDC'' 1.39.43). But “there remain faith, hope, and love, these three; the greatest of these is love” (1 Cor. 13:13). Therefore, although we may be misled in the interpretation of the Bible, we should not miss the target of building up this love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B.
