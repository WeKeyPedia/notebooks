For example, Ancient Greek has the words ''philia'', ''eros'', ''agape'', ''storge'', and ''xenia''. However, with Greek (as with many other languages), it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally. At the same time, the Ancient Greek text of the [[Bible]] has examples of the [[verb]] ''agapo'' having the same meaning as ''[[phileo]]''.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div><del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> </del></div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>''[[Agapē|Agape]]'' ({{polytonic|&amp;#x1f00;&amp;#x03b3;&amp;#x1f71;&amp;#x03c0;&amp;#x03b7;}} ''agápē'') means ''love'' in modern-day Greek.

Influential Christian theologian [[C.S. Lewis]] wrote a book called ''[[The Four Loves]]''. [[Benedict XVI]] wrote his first [[encyclical]] on \"[[Deus caritas est|God is love]].\" He said that a human being, created in the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others ([[agape]]) and by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation (eros). This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as [[Mother Teresa|Teresa of Calcutta]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them.&lt;ref name=\"vatican1\"/&gt;</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>====Islam and Arab====</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>====Islam and Arab====</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>In a sense, love does encompass the Islamic view of life as universal brotherhood that applies to all who hold the faith.
