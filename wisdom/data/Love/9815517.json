Eros was the way to achieve knowledge, though one never truly achieved knowledge according to Plato. Love is smooth, it is not the Eros of mania, or divine madness.  One can say that a person knew they loved a person before they really knew them, but love at first sight is incorrect.  Althought I believe in Plato's idea that Eros came before Knowledge.  Love is Knowing, it is the actual knowledge.  You should not use Eros, do not use mania, but make the love smooth. This smoothness could be Eros tempered by Reason. Smoothness is the key, and love is Knowledge.  </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>'''Love''' has many meanings in [[English language|English]].
