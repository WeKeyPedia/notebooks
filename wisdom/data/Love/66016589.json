Expressions of love may include the love for a soul or mind, the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, and love for the respect of others.  Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive.  Love is essentially an abstract concept, easier to experience than to explain.  Many believe, as stated originally by Virgil that \"Love conquers all\", or as stated by The Beatles, \"All you need is love\".  Bertrand Russell describes love as a condition of 'absolute value', as opposed to 'relative value'.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Types==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Types==</div></td>\n</tr>\n",
