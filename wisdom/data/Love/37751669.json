Generally speaking, most forms of non-romantic love are expressed using the former, while romantic love is expressed using the latter.  \"Parental love\", for example, is ''oya no ai'' (親の愛), while \"to be in love with\" is ''koi suru'' (恋する).  There are of course exceptions, as in the word ''aijin'' (愛人), which means \"lover\" and is interchangeable with ''koibito'' (恋人).</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>In everyday conversation, however, ''ai'' (愛) and ''koi'' (恋) are rarely used.
