God desires to recognize beauty, and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God \"looks\" at itself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is oftentimes referred to as the religion of Love. God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through Love humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace. The saints of Sufism are infamous for being \"drunk\" due to their Love of God hence the constant reference to wine in Sufi poetry and music.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>''[[Ishq]]'', or divine love, is the emphasis of [[Sufism]].
