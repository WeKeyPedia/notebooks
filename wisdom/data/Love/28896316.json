Similarly, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' 'love' of their cause may be borne not of [[interpersonal love]], but impersonal love coupled with [[altruism]] and strong political convictions. People can also 'love' material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding their identity with that item. In some cases there may be an erotic component to such feeling of love. If that desire reaches the point of being acted out, it may be considered unhealthy, and fall under the category of [[paraphilia]].</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>==Religious love==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Whether religious love can be expressed in similar terms to [[interpersonal love]] is a matter for philosophical debate. Religious 'love' might be considered a euphemistic term, more closely describing feelings of [[deference]] or [[acquiescence]]. Most religions use the term love to express the [[devotion]] the follower has to their deity, who may be a living [[guru]] or religious teacher. This love can be expressed by [[prayer]], service, good deeds, and personal [[sacrifice]]. Reciprocally, the followers may believe that the deity loves the followers and all of creation. Some traditions encourage the development of passionate love in the believer for the deity.
