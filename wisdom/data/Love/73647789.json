Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an abstract concept, easier to experience than to explain. Many believe, as stated originally by [[Virgil]], that \"Love conquers all\", or as stated by [[The Beatles]], \"All you need is love\".
