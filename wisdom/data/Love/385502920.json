''Ai'' is used as both a verb (e.g. ''wo ai ni'' 我愛你, or \"I love you\") and a noun (such as ''aiqing'' 愛情, or \"romantic love\"). However, due to the influence of Confucian ''Ren'', the phrase ‘Wo ai ni’ (I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying \"I love you\" as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a more casual way.
