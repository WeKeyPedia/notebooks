Some tackle the difficulty of finding a universal definition for love by classifying it into types, such as passionate love, romantic love, and committed love.  However, some of these types of love can be generalized into the category of sexual attraction. In ordinary use, ''love'' usually refers to interpersonal love, an experience felt by a person for another person. Love often involves caring for or identifying with a person or thing, including oneself (cf. [[narcissism]]).
