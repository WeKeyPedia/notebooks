It is a more potent sentiment than a simple ''liking'' for another. [[Unrequited love]] refers to those feelings of love which are not reciprocated.

In many religions and systems of ethics it is considered wrong to act on sexual desire for immediate family, for children, or outside of a committed relationship. However, there are many ways to express passionate love without sex.
