Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">\"universal</ins> <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">love\"</ins> (''jiān'ài'', 兼愛). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally.  Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations.  Later in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the term ''Ai'' (愛) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, ''Ai'' was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>In contemporary Chinese, ''Ai'' (愛) is often used as the equivalent of the Western concept of love.

The Torah's commandment to love God <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">\"with</ins> all your heart, with all your soul and with all your <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">might\"</ins> ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:5) is taken by the [[Mishnah]] (a central text of the Jewish [[oral law]]) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all of one's possessions, and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5). [[Rabbinic literature]] differs as to how this love can be developed, e.g., by contemplating divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature. As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">\"See</ins> life with the wife you <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">love\"</ins> ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:9).
