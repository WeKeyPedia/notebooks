It would be very difficult to explain love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved. In fact, to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of love there are: [[psychology|psychological]] theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; there are [[Evolutionary theory|evolutionary theories]] which hold that love is part of the process of [[natural selection]]; there are [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual theories]] which may, for instance consider love to be a gift from God; there are also theories that consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a [[mysticism|mystical experience]].</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 274:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 277:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>{{Link GA|de}}</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>{{Link GA|de}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>{{Link GA|zh}}</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>{{Link GA|zh}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[als:Liebe]]</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[als:Liebe]]</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[am:ፍቅር]]</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[am:ፍቅር]]</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:524099514:newid:527362611 -->\n",
