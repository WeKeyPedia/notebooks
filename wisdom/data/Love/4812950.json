According to current scientific understanding of love, this transition from attraction to attachment phase usually happens in about 30 months. After that passion fades, changing love from [[Consummate]] to Companionate, or from Romantic love to Liking. Note that the feeling which Sternberg terms ''passion'' is similar to, if not the same as, that termed ''[[limerence]]'' by [[Dorothy Tennov]]. This last stage may last 10-15 years, until the children grow to the teen age, or longer, depending on cultural and other factors.
