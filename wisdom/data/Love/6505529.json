For example, ancient Greek has the words ''[[philia]]'' (love between friends), ''[[Eros_(god)|eros]]'' (romantic/sexual love), ''[[agape]]'' (unconditional, possibly sacrificial/unreciprocated love), and ''[[storge]]'' (affection/familial love). However, with Greek as with many other languages, it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally, and so we can find examples of ''agape'' being used with much the same meaning as ''eros''.  At the same time the ancient Greek text of the [[Bible]] has examples of the [[verb]] ''agapo'' being used with the same meaning as ''phileo''.  [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] contains the word 'ahava' for 'affection' or 'favour' but most notable is the word 'khesed', which basically combines the meaning of 'affection' and 'compassion' and is sometimes rendered in English as 'loving-kindness'.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Love is one of the most common themes in art.
