For example, ancient Greek has the words ''[[philia]]'', ''[[Eros_(god)|eros]]'', ''[[agape]]'', and ''[[storge]]'', meaning love between friends, romantic/sexual love, unconditional (possibly sacrificial, unreciprocated) love, and affection/familial love respectively.  However, with Greek as with many other languages, it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally, and so we can find examples of ''agape'' being used with much the same meaning as ''eros''.  At the same time the ancient Greek text of the [[Bible]] has examples of the [[verb]] ''agapo'' being used with the same meaning as ''phileo''.
