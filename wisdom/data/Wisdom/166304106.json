Unlike conventional wisdom, which encompasses age &amp; experience, Wisdom as a stat in [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons|D&amp;D]] describes a character's will, judgment, guile, enlightenment, insight, and in later editions perception as well.  It influences a priest's mystical powers/spells and any character's will-based [[saving throw]]s (such as against mental attacks by charms, phantasms, etc.)  Wisdom and Will as a character stat would later appear in many other book/dice and computer/console [[Role-playing game|RPGs (Role Playing Games)]]{{Fact|date=September 2007}}.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Quotations about wisdom==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Quotations about wisdom==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:164677440:newid:166304106 -->\n",
