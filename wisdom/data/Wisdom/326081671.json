Beyond simply knowing/understanding what options are available, \"Wisdom\" provides the ability to differentiate between them and choose the one that is best. What this means exactly depends on the various wisdom schools and traditions claiming to help foster it. In general, these schools have emphasized various combinations of the following:  [[knowledge]], [[understanding]], [[experience]], discipline, discretion, and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive understanding]], along with a capacity to apply these qualities well towards finding solutions to [[problem]]s. In many traditions, the terms wisdom and [[intelligence]] have somewhat overlapping meanings; in others they are arranged hierarchically, with intelligence being necessary but not sufficient for wisdom.</ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[Neo-Platonist]]s like [[Cusanus]], endorsed a 'docta ignorantia' in which the greatest wisdom was to recognize one's own ignorance of the [[divine]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[Neo-Platonist]]s like [[Cusanus]], endorsed a 'docta ignorantia' in which the greatest wisdom was to recognize one's own ignorance of the [[divine]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. </div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:326058242:newid:326081671 -->\n",
