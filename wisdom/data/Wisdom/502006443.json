He separates belief and wisdom by refer to belief as neither truth or falseness. And refer to wisdom as that one comes to know as truth by deep understanding and from what one fully knows from one's own experiences. One example is how does one know if spirits exist if one has never experienced spirit encounters? For him, he knows that they exist, for he has years of experience of spirit encounters. While those who believe in such, and never actually experience such, only know that is belief, and belief is not wisdom. Wisdom is truth, wisdom is knowing that in which is a certainty from ones own clarity from experience. He also teaches ego minds are limited to truth, for all remain a sleep in their own beliefs or delusions. In order to cultivate wisdom, one must explore for that truth other wise one's truth may be nothing more than belief. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Philosophical perspectives of wisdom ==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Philosophical perspectives of wisdom ==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:500855174:newid:502006443 -->\n",
