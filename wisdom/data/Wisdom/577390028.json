Legesse et al., a neuropsychiatrist at [[McLean Hospital]]/[[Harvard Medical School]], offers \"a theoretical definition that takes into account many cultural, religious, and philosophical themes is that wisdom represents a demonstrated superior ability to understand the nature and behavior of things, people, or events.\"  He states \"this results in an increased ability to predict behavior or events which then may be used to benefit self or others.\" He furthermore adds \"there is more often a desire to share the accrued benefits with a larger group for the purpose of promoting survival, cohesion, or well-being of that group. The benefits do not result from malicious or antisocial intents or inequitable behavior. Environmental factors, such as family, education, socioeconomic status, culture, and religion, are involved in generating the milieu in which the personal value system develops. Many of these same factors also influence how a given community decides whether wisdom is present or not. This model of wisdom relies on the individual’s ability to generate a mental representation of the self (cognitive, emotional, and physical), the external world, and the dynamic relationship of the self with the external world.\" Dr. Legesse proposes that \"the neural (brain) systems critical to enable these functions are distributed but heavily dependent on those that support [[memory]], learning, understanding other people’s mental states ([[Theory of Mind]]), and assigning relative value to information.\" The neuroanatomy of wisdom he says depends on \"the three frontosubcortical neural networks, the [[limbic]] system, and the [[mirror neuron]] system\" which \"are of particular importance for supporting these activities.\" He describes the function of this neural system as working \"in concert to weigh and estimate the risks and benefits of various mentally modeled courses of action to generate wisdom.\" It was proposed that \"the neural substrates of [[empathy]] may be conceptualized as biasing the information processing network in favor of valuing others, interpersonal communication, cooperation, and community.\" &lt;ref&gt;Legesse B, Price BH., Murray ED Brain-Behavior Relations.
