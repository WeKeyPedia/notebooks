For example, ''freethinkers'' and others believe that wisdom may come from pure (reason) and perhaps experience, while others believe that it comes from [intuition (knowledge)] or [spirituality].Beginning with the ancient Greeks, European culture associates wisdom with [virtue]. [Metis (mythology)] and [[Athene]] are associated with wisdom from earliest times. For example, many philosophers talk about the virtue of wisdom in relation to courage and moderation, and in the [Roman Catholic] church, wisdom ([[Prudence]]) stands with [justice], [fortitude] and [[moderation]] as one of the four [[cardinal virtues]]. [[Plato]]'s dialogues mention the virtue of wisdom, as knowledge about the Good and the ''courage'' to act accordingly.  The ''Good'' would be about the right relations between all that exists.  The Good, as a Platonic, would involve the perfect ideas of good government, love, friendship, community, and a right relation to the Divine.  Perhaps the search or love of wisdom is more important than any proven claim.  Socrates only claimed to know that he did not know, but this he was very certain of, and he showed the many contradictions in the claims of his fellow citizens.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>In the (Inuit) tradition, developing wisdom was the aim of teaching.

Beyond simply knowing/understanding what options are available, \"Wisdom\" provides the ability to differentiate between them and choose the one that is best. What this means exactly depends on the various wisdom schools and traditions claiming to help foster it. In general, these schools have emphasized various combinations of the following:  [[knowledge]], [[understanding]], [[experience]], discipline, discretion, and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive understanding]], along with a capacity to apply these qualities well towards finding solutions to ''problems''. In many traditions, the terms wisdom and \"intelligence\" have somewhat overlapping meanings; in others they are arranged hierarchically, with intelligence being necessary but not sufficient for wisdom. </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div><del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">According</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">to</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">Rice</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">(1958)</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">two</del> wisdom <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">traditions</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">can</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">be identified in</del> the <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">(Renaissance):</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">''Contemplative'' and ''prudential''.
