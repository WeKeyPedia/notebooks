Wisdom is also the comprehension of what is true or right coupled with optimum judgment as to action. Synonyms include: sagacity, discernment, or insight.<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">    Dr. Rex Julian Beaber has proposed a somewhat different conceptualization of wisdom.  That is, wisdom reflects the capacity to choose a course of action which in all probability will, over the long term, maximize life satisfaction and achievement.  In this regard, Dr. Beaber views the core capacity in generating wisdom as the ability to balance the hedonic equation in the long and short term, weighing probable outcomes with an appreciation of the gestalt of life forces. This view has been criticized as narcissistic because wisdom is viewed only in terms of the optimization of life satisfaction for the individual.    Accordingly, others have amended Dr. Beaber's approach by suggesting that maximization of satisfaction for the relevant social group is the proper core for sagacity.  Finally, Dr. Beaber suggests that wisdom may rest as much with an understanding of pragmatic reality as with abstract universal principles.  He points out that one of the most difficult questions concerning \"alleged\" wisdom is epistemological, i.e., is there a method of validating the \"wisdom\" reflected in a life directive without first accepting some core meta-wisdom.  For example, Dr. Beaber raises the question: \"Can it be shown that some particular life directive is unwise by reference to some neutral criteria, i.e., something that can be measured?  While Dr. Beaber has proposed either individual or group life-satisfaction is a difficult to measure but theoretically measurable operational definition of wisdom, the proposal is problematic because it excludes \"right\" moral choices that vindicate affirmative values while causing social pain.  In the final analysis, we are left with a paradox in most approaches to wisdom, i.e., it would appear that wisdom itself must be the individual capacity that allows a correct recognition of what life directives are, in fact, wise!</del></div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>'''Wisdom''' is a deep understanding and realization of people, things, events or situations, resulting in the ability to apply perceptions, judgements and actions in keeping with this understanding.
