Much of the [[Book of Proverbs]], a book of wise sayings,  is attributed to Solomon.  In Proverbs 1:7 and 9:10, the [[Fear of the lord|fear of the Lord]] is called the beginning or foundation of wisdom while Proverbs 8:13 declares \"To fear the Lord is to hate evil\".  In Proverbs 1:20, there is also reference to wisdom personified in female form, \"Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares.\"</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>===New Testament===</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>{{See|Sophia_(wisdom)}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Furthermore, there is an oppositional element in Christian thought between [[secular]] wisdom and Godly wisdom.  The [[apostle Paul]] states that worldly wisdom thinks the claims of [[Christ]] to be foolishness.  However, to those who are being saved Christ represents the wisdom of God.  ([[1 Corinthians]] 1:17-31) Also, Wisdom is one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] according to Anglican, Catholic, and Lutheran belief. 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 gives an alternate list of nine virtues, among which wisdom is one.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>===Qur'an===</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>In [[Islam]], according to the [[Qur'an]], all of the prophets of the Old Testament, Jesus, as well as the Prophet [[Muhammad]] were chosen by Allah, mostly in times of political or moral crisis, to represent his wisdom.
