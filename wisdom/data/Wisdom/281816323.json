Again in order to have fragrance you have to cultivate the flower. For superior fragrance you will have to nurture the flower by giving it better fertilizer, watering appropriately, exposing it to the right amount of sunlight etc. Similarly to cultivate wisdom you will have to find ways of educating the brain emotionally to a super mature emotionally intelligent level. An emotionally super mature brain becomes wise automatically. A super mature brain is a wise brain. So when you read books on wisdom it’s like reading books on fragrance. As Eddie Morrow from Houston said you will really know as much about fragrance after reading the book as much as you knew before reading the book.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>The brain is like a flower and wisdom is its fragrance.

Thus wisdom education means learning to take out the emotional baggage from the brain. When the brain is squeaky clean emotionally it sprouts wisdom automatically. To have wisdom means to have a super mature emotionally intelligent brain. Also wisdom = +2 emotional intelligence = self mastery. All three are the one and same entity! To be super emotionally intelligent means to be wise and to be wise means to be a self master. So to become wise develop your emotional intelligence to the super mature +2 brain level.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:281809759:newid:281816323 -->\n",
