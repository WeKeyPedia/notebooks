Wisdom is also the comprehension of what is true or right coupled with optimum judgment as to action. Synonyms include: sagacity, discernment, or insight.    Dr. Rex Julian Beaber has proposed a somewhat different conceptualization of wisdom.  That is, wisdom reflects the capacity to choose a course of action which in all probability will, over the long term, maximize life satisfaction and achievement.  In this regard, Dr. Beaber views the core capacity in generating wisdom as the ability to balance the hedonic equation in the long and short term, weighing probable outcomes with an appreciation of the gestalt of life forces. This view has been criticized as narcissistic because wisdom is viewed only in terms of the optimization of life satisfaction for the individual.    Accordingly, others have amended Dr. Beaber's approach by suggesting that maximization of satisfaction for the relevant social group is the proper core for sagacity.
