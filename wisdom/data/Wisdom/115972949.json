These virtues are praised under other names in many passages of Scripture.  [[Plato]]'s dialogues mention the virtue of wisdom, as knowledge about the Good and the [[courage]] to act accordingly.  The [[Good]] would be about the right relations between all that exists.  The Good, as a Platonic [[Form]], would involve the perfect ideas of good government, love, friendship, community, and a right relation to the Divine.  Perhaps the search or love of wisdom is more important than any proven claim.
