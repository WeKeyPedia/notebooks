[[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] and [[Athene]] are associated with wisdom from earliest times. For example, many philosophers talk about the virtue of wisdom in relation to courage and moderation, and in the [[Roman Catholic]] church, wisdom ([[Prudence]]) stands with [[justice]], [[fortitude]] and [[moderation]] as one of the four [[cardinal virtues]]. [[Plato]]'s dialogues mention the virtue of wisdom, as knowledge about the Good and the [[courage]] to act accordingly.  The [[Good]] would be about the right relations between all that exists.  The Good, as a Platonic [[Form]], would involve the perfect ideas of good government, love, friendship, community, and a right relation to the Divine.  Perhaps the search or love of wisdom is more important than any proven claim.  Socrates only claimed to know that he did not know, but this he was very certain of, and he showed the many contradictions in the claims of his fellow citizens{{Fact|date=May 2007}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>[[Holistic|Holists]] believe that wise people sense, work with and align themselves and others to [[life]].
