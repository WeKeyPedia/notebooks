Wisdom as per The Hindu religion is knowing oneself as the truth, basis for the entire Creation,i.e \"Shristi\". In other words \"wisdom\" simply means a person with Self Awarness as the one who witnesses  the Entire creation in all its facets and forms. Further it means realization that an individual,i.e \"Jeeva\" Atma, through 'right conduct and living' over an unspecified period( it varies from individual to idividual)comes to realize his/her true relationship with the creation and the 'God' who rules it.</ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>In [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamian religion and mythology]], [[Enki]], also known as Ea, was the God of wisdom and intelligence.
