This permeates Plato's [[dialogues]], especially ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', in which the leaders of his proposed [[utopia]] are to be [[philosopher king]]s: rulers who understand the [[Form of the Good]] and possess the courage to act accordingly. [[Aristotle]], in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', defined wisdom as the understanding of causes, i.e. knowing ''why'' things are a certain way, which is deeper than merely knowing ''that'' things are a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;But note that two thousand years after Aristotle, Isaac Newton was forced to [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|admit that]] \"I have not yet been able to discover the cause of these properties of gravity\"&lt;/ref&gt;</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Wisdom is also important within [[Christianity]].

[[Prudence]], which is intimately related to wisdom, became one of the four [[cardinal virtues]] of [[Catholicism]].
