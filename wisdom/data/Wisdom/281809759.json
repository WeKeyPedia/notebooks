The attributes of wisdom are its fruit. As man knows the attributes of wisdom man tries to teach these attributes. It is very difficult and frustrating to cultivate these attributes because it is the same as trying to produce bananas without the banana tree. Cultivate the tree and the bananas will emerge automatically.  </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>  </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>WISDOM EDUCATION REALLY MEANS BRAIN EDUCATION. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>The brain is like a flower and wisdom is its fragrance. Can you even explain and teach fragrance no matter how many ways it is described. The only way you can know fragrance is by smelling the flower. Again in order to have fragrance you have to cultivate the flower. For superior fragrance you will have to nurture the flower by giving it better fertilizer, watering appropriately, exposing it to the right amount of sunlight etc. Similarly to cultivate wisdom you will have to find ways of educating the brain emotionally to a super mature emotionally intelligent level. An emotionally super mature brain becomes wise automatically. A super mature brain is a wise brain. So when you read books on wisdom it’s like reading books on fragrance. As Eddie Morrow from Houston said you will really know as much about fragrance after reading the book as much as you knew before reading the book.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>According to Rice (1958) two wisdom traditions can be identified in the Renaissance: Contemplative and prudential.
