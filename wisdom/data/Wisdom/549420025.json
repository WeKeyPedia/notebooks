Thus when a human is unable to be humane, he or she does not qualify to be a human but an animal. But when a human is able to be humane, for example, when Buddhism first introduced to China in the Han Dynasty the Chinese people translated the Buddha's name into \"able to be human\" or someone with ”ability and humanity\" (能人，能仁) because Confucius's teachings and the Buddha's teachings are \"one to two, two to one.\"</ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>:如+心=恕 (shù) like or as if on top heart or mind below, means forgiveness and consideration.
