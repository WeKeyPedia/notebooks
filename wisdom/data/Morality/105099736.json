''Letters from Exile: Observations on a Culture in Decline''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. &lt;/ref&gt;.  The latter she characterizes as predominantly negative and proscriptive: it defines a person’s territory, including his or property and dependants, which is not to be damaged or interfered with.  Apart from these proscriptions, territorial morality is permissive, allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another. By contrast, tribal morality is prescriptive, imposing the norms of the collective on the individual.  These norms will be arbitrary, culturally dependent and ‘flexible’, whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute, such as [[Kant]]’s ‘[[categorical imperative]]’.  Green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property, and the ascendancy of contract over status.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Morality in judicial systems==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Morality in judicial systems==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 70:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 72:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>The opposite belief, imposing various degrees of standardization via a [[moral code]] and its enforcement, usually in a [[legal system]], is that such cores either can be shared or are irrelevant to the process of social control and learning proper conduct.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>The opposite belief, imposing various degrees of standardization via a [[moral code]] and its enforcement, usually in a [[legal system]], is that such cores either can be shared or are irrelevant to the process of social control and learning proper conduct.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>==References==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>&lt;references/&gt;</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== See also ==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== See also ==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:104912310:newid:105099736 -->\n",
