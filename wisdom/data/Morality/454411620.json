The neurons fire in imitation of the action being observed, causing the same muscles to act minutely in the observer as are acting grossly in the person actually performing the action. Research on ''[[mirror neuron]]s'', since their discovery in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Giacomo Rizzolatti et al. (1996). ''Premotor cortex and the recognition of motor actions'', Cognitive Brain Research 3 131–141&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that they may have a role to play not only in action understanding, but also in emotion sharing [[empathy]]. Cognitive neuro-scientist [[Jean Decety]] thinks that the ability to recognize and vicariously experience what another individual is undergoing was a key step forward in the evolution of social behavior, and ultimately, morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/27/AR2007052701056_pf.html | work=The Washington Post | title=If It Feels Good to Be Good, It Might Be Only Natural | first=Shankar | last=Vedantam | accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inability to feel empathy is one of the defining characteristics of [[psychopath]]y, and this would appear to lend support to Decety's view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=de Wied M, Goudena PP, Matthys W |title=Empathy in boys with disruptive behavior disorders |journal=Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines |volume=46 |issue=8 |pages=867–80 |year=2005 |pmid=16033635 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00389.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Fernandez YM, Marshall WL |title=Victim empathy, social self-esteem, and psychopathy in rapists |journal=Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=11–26 |year=2003 |pmid=12616926 |doi=10.1023/A:1020611606754}}&lt;/ref&gt;</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>===Neuroimaging and stimulation===</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>The explicit making of moral right and wrong judgments coincides with activation in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] while intuitive reactions to situations containing implicit moral issues activates the [[temporoparietal junction]] area.&lt;ref&gt;Harenski CL, Antonenko O, Shane MS, Kiehl KA.
