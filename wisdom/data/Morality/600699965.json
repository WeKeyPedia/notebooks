Different systems of expressing morality have been proposed, including [[Deontological ethics|deontological ethical]] systems which adhere to a set of established rules, and [[Normative ethics|normative]] ethical systems which consider the merits of actions themselves. An example of normative ethical philosophy is the [[Golden Rule]] which states that, \"One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.\"&lt;ref name = \"Flew\"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia  |title=golden rule|editor =[[Antony Flew]]    | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Philosophy | publisher = [[Pan Books]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|The MacMillan Press]]   | year = 1979   | location = London | page = 134 | isbn = 9780333262047 }} This dictionary of philosophy contains the following under the entry for \"golden rule\": \"The maxim 'Treat others how you wish to be treated'. Various expressions of this fundamental moral rule are to be found in tenets of most religions and creeds through the ages, testifying to its universal applicability.\" [[Walter Terence Stace]] argued that the Golden Rule is much more than simply an [[ethics|ethical code]]. He posits that it \"express[es] the essence of a universal morality.\" The rationale for this distinction occupies much of his book ''The Concept of Morals'' (1937). {{cite book | last = Stace | first = Walter T. | title = The Concept of Morals | publisher = The MacMillan Company; and also reprinted by Peter Smith Publisher Inc, January 1990 | date = 1937, Reprinted 1975 by permission of MacMillan Publishing Co.
