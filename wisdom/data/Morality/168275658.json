Apart from these proscriptions, territorial morality is permissive, allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another. By contrast, tribal morality is prescriptive, imposing the norms of the collective on the individual.  These norms will be arbitrary, culturally dependent and ‘flexible’, whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute, such as [[Kant]]’s ‘[[categorical imperative]]’.  Green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property, and the ascendancy of contract over status.<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">RUNESCAPE IS SICKOOOOO</del></div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>[[Celia Green]]  has made a distinction between tribal and territorial morality.&lt;ref name = \"Green\"&gt;Green, Celia (2004).
