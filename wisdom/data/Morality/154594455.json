One approach argues that moral codes are founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were naturally selected in the past because they aided survival and reproduction ([[inclusive fitness]]), and that they still generally prescribe behavior that enhances individual fitness and/or group well-being. Selected psychological and behavioral tendencies, and their abstraction in to moral codes or religions, are seen to be common to most or all human cultures. For example, the near-universal taboo against [[inbreeding]] encourages individuals to avoid producing defective offspring. [[Reciprocity]] ensures a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. For example, on any given night for [[vampire bat]]s, some individuals fail to feed on prey while others consume a surplus of blood. Bats that have successfully fed then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984)</del>. </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>While some philosophers, psychologists and evolutionary biologists hold that morality is a thin crust hiding [[egoism]], [[amorality]], and anti-social tendencies, others see . </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div><del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">Christopher</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">Boehm</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">(1982) has hypothesized that the incremental development of moral complexity throughout [[Hominidae|hominid]] evolution was due to the increasing need to avoid disputes and injuries in moving to open savanna and developing stone weapons.
