Proponents of what could be called \"Natural Outgrowth Theory\" see no conflict between evolutionary biology and morality since moral codes generally prescribe behavior that enhances individual fitness and group well-being. For example, the taboo against [[inbreeding]] encourages individuals to avoid producing defective offspring that would depress their reproductive [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Compliance with and internalization of social conventions leads to a sense of regularity that makes group living more predictable and hence, less stressful, for its members. [[Reciprocity]] ensures a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. On any given night for [[vampire bat|vampire bats]], some individuals fail to feed on prey while others consume a surplus of blood. Bats that have successfully fed then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984). </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>While some philosophers and biologists hold that [[morality]] is a thin crust hiding [[egoism]], [[amorality]], and anti-social tendencies, others see morality as a product of evolutionary forces and as evidence for continuity with other group-living organisms.
