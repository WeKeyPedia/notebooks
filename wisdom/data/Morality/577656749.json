Androids lack morality. Likewise, choosing between chocolate or vanilla is not a moral choice, but one that is amoral, does not raise ethical questions. Does not obligate one to consider the interests of others who could be affected. Importantly \"amoral\" should not be confused with meaning \"lacking morals,\" \"antisocial,\" or \"criminally corrupt.\" Amoral descriptions regard cases and actions that carry no moral obligation or duty by being devoid of any moral quandary. </ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>{{Cite book| last = Superson | first = Anita | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Moral Skeptic | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | location = | pages = 127–159 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-19-537662-3 }}</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>{{Cite book| last = Superson | first = Anita | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Moral Skeptic | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | location = | pages = 127–159 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-19-537662-3 }}</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:577655075:newid:577656749 -->\n",
