In certain religious communities, the [[divinity|Divine]] is said to provide these principles through [[revelation]], sometimes in great detail. Such codes may be called laws, as in the [[Torah|Law of Moses]], or community morality may be defined through commentary on the texts of revelation, as in [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Such codes are distinguished from legal or judicial [[right]], including [[civil rights]], which are based on the accumulated traditions, decrees and legislation of a political authority, though these latter often invoke the authority of the moral law.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Morality can also be seen as the collection of beliefs as to what constitutes a good life. Since throughout most of [[human]] [[history]], [[religion]]s have provided both visions and regulations for an [[ideal]] life, morality is often confused with religious [[precept]]s. In secular communities, [[lifestyle]] choices, which represent an [[individual]]'s conception of the good life, are often discussed in terms of \"morality\". Individuals sometimes feel that making an appropriate lifestyle choice invokes a true morality, and that accepted codes of conduct within their chosen community are fundamentally moral, even when such codes deviate from more general social principles. </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>The systematic study of morality is a branch of [[philosophy]] called [[ethics]].
