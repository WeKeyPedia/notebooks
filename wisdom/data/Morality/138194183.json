They found that such a loss of morality does not seem to be borne out in the data he studied. If anything, among western democracies, it might be the other way around, especially for dualist Christianity, that is to say in societies where the belief both that a God and a devil exist is strong.&lt;ref name = \"Paul\"&gt;[[Gregory S.
