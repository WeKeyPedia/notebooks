Although some people might think that a moral code is simple, rarely is there anything simple about one's [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[ethics]], etc. or, for that matter, the judgment of those of others. The difficulty lies in the fact that morals are often part of a [[religion]] and more often than not about [[culture]] codes. Sometimes, moral codes give way to [[legal code]]s, which couple penalties or corrective actions with particular practices. Note that while many legal codes are merely built on a foundation of religious and/or cultural moral codes, ofttimes they are one and the same.</ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Moral codes are often complex definitions of right and wrong that are based upon well-defined [[value systems]].
