''Letters from Exile: Observations on a Culture in Decline''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. Chapters I-XX. &lt;/ref&gt; She characterizes the latter as predominantly negative and proscriptive: it defines a person’s territory, including his or her property and dependents, which is not to be damaged or interfered with. Apart from these proscriptions, territorial morality is permissive, allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another. By contrast, tribal morality is prescriptive, imposing the norms of the collective on the individual. These norms will be arbitrary, culturally dependent and ‘flexible’, whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s ‘[[categorical imperative]]’. Green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property, and the ascendancy of contract over status.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>=== In-group and out-group ===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>=== In-group and out-group ===</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 51:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 21:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>=== Comparing cultures ===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>=== Comparing cultures ===</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Peterson and Seligman &lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Christopher, and Martin E.

For example, on any given night for [[vampire bat]]s, some individuals fail to feed on prey while others consume a surplus of blood. Bats that have successfully fed then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984)</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>It has been convincingly demonstrated that chimpanzees show empathy for each other in a wide variety of contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O’Connell |first= Sanjida |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1995|month= July|title= Empathy in chimpanzees: Evidence for theory of mind? |journal= primates|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 397–410|id= 0032-8332 |url= |accessdate= 2007-11-08 |quote=|doi= 10.1007/BF02382862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also possess the ability to engage in deception, and a level of social 'politics'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674356616 Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals].&lt;/ref&gt; prototypical of our own tendencies for [[gossip]] and [[reputation]] management.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>&lt;!-- [[hypocrisy]] Johnathan Haidt --&gt;</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Christopher Boehm (1982) has hypothesized that the incremental development of moral complexity throughout [[Great ape|hominid]] evolution was due to the increasing need to avoid disputes and injuries in moving to open savanna and developing stone weapons.

[[Richard Dawkins]] in ''[[The God Delusion]]'' suggested that our morality is a result of our biological evolutionary history and that the [[Moral Zeitgeist]] helps describe how morality evolves from biological and cultural origins and evolves with time within a culture.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>== Neuroscientific and psychiatric perspectives ==</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>=== Mirror-neurons ===</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Research on ''[[mirror neuron]]s'', since their discovery in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Giacomo Rizzolatti et al.
