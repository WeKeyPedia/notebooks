In meta-ethics, a key issue is what is meant by the terms right or wrong. [[Moral realism]] would hold that the individual is attempting to elucidate some objective moral fact, whereas the various branches of [[moral non-realism]] would hold that morality is derived from: the [[norm (sociology)|norms]] of the prevalent society ([[cultural relativism]]); the edicts of a god ([[divine command theory]]); is merely an expression of the speakers sentiments ([[emotivism]]); an implied imperative ([[prescriptivism (philosophy)|prescriptivism]]); or literally nonsense ([[error theory]]). Some thinkers hold that there is no correct definition of right behavior, that morality can only be judged with respect to particular situations, within the standards of particular belief systems and socio-historical contexts.

Moral absolutists might concede that forces of social [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] significantly shape moral decisions, but deny that cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[convention (norm)|custom]]s define morally right behavior.
