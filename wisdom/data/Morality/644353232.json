Some evolutionary biologists, particularly sociobiologists, believe that morality is a product of evolutionary forces acting at an individual level and also at the group level through [[group selection]] (though to what degree this actually occurs is a controversial topic in evolutionary theory). Some sociobiologists contend that the set of behaviors that constitute morality evolved largely because they provided possible survival and/or reproductive benefits (i.e. increased evolutionary success). Humans consequently evolved \"pro-social\" emotions, such as feelings of empathy or guilt, in response to these moral behaviors. Conversely, it has been argued by other biologists that humans developed truly moral, altruistic instincts.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>The development of modern morality is a process closely tied to the [[<ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">sociocultural</ins> evolution]] of different peoples of humanity.
