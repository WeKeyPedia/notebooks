Morals are arbitrarily created and subjectively defined by [[society]], [[philosophy]], [[religion]], and/or individual [[conscience]].  An example of the descriptive usage could be \"common conceptions of morality have changed significantly over time.\" The arbitrariness of morality stems from the observation that actions that may be deemed moral in one culture in time may not be classified as such in others or in a different time. The subjectiveness of morality is shown by the observation that actions or beliefs which by themselves do not cause any harm may be by some considered immoral, e.g. marrying someone of same gender, being an atheist, etc. Descriptive morality does not explain why anything should be considered immoral, only that it may be classified so. While for the most part immoral acts are classified as such because they cause harm, this is not by any means an all encompassing criterion. Many acts or beliefs are often then classified as such because of prejudice, ignorance or even hatred.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>In its second, normative and universal sense, morality refers to an ideal code of belief and conduct, one which would be espoused in preference to other alternatives by the sane \"moral\" person, under specified conditions.

While descriptive morality would not necessarily disagree that \"murder is immoral\", it would nevertheless propose that murder is immoral only because we so thought.

Apart from these proscriptions, territorial morality is permissive, allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another. By contrast, tribal morality is prescriptive, imposing the norms of the collective on the individual. These norms will be arbitrary, culturally dependent and ‘flexible’, whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s ‘[[categorical imperative]]’.

[[Social psychology|Social psychologists]] such as [[Martin Hoffman]] and [[Jonathan Haidt]] emphasize social and emotional development based on biology, such as [[empathy]]. Moral identity theorists, such as [[William Damon]] and [[Mordechai Nisan]], see moral commitment as arising from the development of a self-identity that is defined by moral purposes: this moral self-identity leads to a sense of responsibility to pursue such purposes. Of historical interest in psychology are the theories of [[psychoanalyst]]s such as [[Sigmund Freud]], who believe that moral development is the product of aspects of the [[super-ego]] as guilt-shame avoidance.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>== Morality and politics ==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>If morality is the answer to the question 'how ought we to live' at the individual level, politics can be seen as addressing the same question at the social level.
