Does this entitle them to a higher social spot within the community?  Well, back to what I said before.  I believe a person becomes who they are by their social upbringing. If they are superior in knowledge of religion, philosophy, or culture, they yes, they may be inferior within the social society.  Does this make them morrally superior?

For many individuals, morality is influenced, to a large degree, not by [[religion]] or [[theology]], but other, secular, ethical codes are also followed.  Religions typically hold that morality is not a human construct, but is the work of [[God]].  For example, in Judeo-Christian religions, one or another version of the [[Ten Commandments]] is held to have been issued directly to mankind by God.  Moreover, religions often hold that the human [[conscience]], the internal mechanism through which one senses the moral aspect of actions, is infused in mankind by God. Non-religious individuals may justify morality on the basis of that improving the [[human condition]] or helping humanity is itself fundamentally 'good': they may aspire to base morality on [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian principles]] of reciprocal behaviour and prevention of suffering or through 'objective' approaches, such as [[utilitarianism]]</ins>.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>&lt;!-- Many groups may, effectively, be distinguished by their morality, as a fundamental characteristic; in some cases, the common view on morality can be a basic factor of aggregation, as it happens in developed countries where the complexity of social structures causes (for other reasons) the need of building inside them sub-groups, identified by a common belief or view upon certain matters. This process, indeed, shows a similarity with the process of creation of politicals regroupements, and in fact sometimes the two fields (not always reciprocally) interfere. --&gt;</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>For [[moral relativism|moral relativists]], morality is viewed as a system of personal ethical conduct that the individual imposes on himself or herself.
