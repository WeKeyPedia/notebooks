They define morality as \"a suite of interrelated other-regarding behaviors that cultivate and regulate complex interactions within social groups.\" This suite of behaviors includes empathy, reciprocity, altruism, cooperation, and a sense of fairness. &lt;ref&gt;Bekoff, Marc and Jessica Pierce ''Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals'' (Chicago, The University of Chicago Press 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In related work, it</ins> has been convincingly demonstrated that chimpanzees show empathy for each other in a wide variety of contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O’Connell |first= Sanjida |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1995|month= July|title= Empathy in chimpanzees: Evidence for theory of mind? |journal= primates|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 397–410|id= 0032-8332 |url= |accessdate= 2007-11-08 |quote=|doi= 10.1007/BF02382862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also possess the ability to engage in deception, and a level of social 'politics'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674356616 Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals].&lt;/ref&gt; prototypical of our own tendencies for [[gossip]] and [[reputation]] management.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>&lt;!-- [[hypocrisy]] Johnathan Haidt --&gt;</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>&lt;!-- [[hypocrisy]] Johnathan Haidt --&gt;</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:285921216:newid:286502591 -->\n",
