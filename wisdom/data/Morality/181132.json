We know of no species sufficiently unlike humans and sufficiently intelligent to test this idea properly, but the nearest we can come to it is the [[octopus]].  This is a kind of [[mollusc]], related to clams and snails, but it is remarkably intelligent.  In experiments, octopuses have solved problems that require quite sophisticated abstract reasoning.  Their life-cycle is very different from our own, however.  In particular, their strategy for ensuring the survival of their offspring is not to care for their children, but to have hundreds of thousands of them at once, the sheer weight of numbers ensuring that by chance some will avoid being eaten and will grow to adulthood.  The mother dies shortly after giving birth.  Now, suppose there existed some kind of super-octopus whose intelligence was comparable to humans.  Philosophical and theological objections to the concept of non-human morality aside, it seems likely that these hypothetical beings would have a very different sense of \"right\" and \"wrong\" from our own.  The notion might be taken to suggest that right and wrong are not universal absolutes, but are particular to the species.  This speculation is not intended to imply that morality is unimportant, nor to support the idea of [[moral relativism]].  It may be reasonable to suppose that if our generally accepted notions of right and wrong are the result of millions of years of evolution, then they are near to being absolutely correct, for us.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>---- </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>---- </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 29:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 29:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Compare: [[ethics]]</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Compare: [[ethics]]</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div> </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:120804:newid:181132 -->\n",
