Belief in an effective system of divine [[Last Judgment|judgment]] often helps with personal motivation, as classically seen in the success of Medieval codes of [[chivalry|knighthood]] and the spread of [[Islam]]. The desire to [[conformity|conform]] to the behavior of a group to which an individual belongs or aspires to belong is also a powerful force, though it may generally apply to more general cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[convention (norm)|custom]]s, where the dichotomy is between proper and improper behavior. </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Group morality develops from shared [[concept]]s and [[belief]]s and is often codified to regulate behavior within a [[culture]] or community. Various defined actions come to be called moral or immoral. Individuals who choose moral action are popularly held to possess \"moral fibre\", whereas those who indulge in immoral behavior may be labelled as socially [[degenerate]]. The continued existence of a group may depend on widespread conformity to codes of morality; an inability to adjust moral codes in response to new challenges is sometimes credited with the demise of a community (a positive example would be the function of [[Cistercian]] reform in reviving monasticism; a negative example would be the role of the [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Dowager Empress]] in the subjugation of China to European interests). Within [[nationalist]] movements, there has been some tendency to feel that a nation will not survive or prosper without acknowledging one, common morality.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Codified morality is generally distinguished from [[norm|custom]], another way for a community to define appropriate activity, by the former's derivation from [[Natural rights|natural]] or universal principles. In certain religious communities, the [[Divine]] is said to provide these principles through [[revelation]], sometimes in great detail. Such codes may be called laws, as in the [[Torah|Law of Moses]], or community morality may be defined through commentary on the texts of revelation, as in [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Such codes are distinguished from legal or judicial [[right]], including [[civil rights]], which are based on the accumulated traditions, decrees and legislation of a political authority, though these latter often invoke the authority of the moral law.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Morality can also be seen as the collection of beliefs as to what constitutes a good life. Since throughout most of [[human]] [[history]], [[religion]]s have provided both visions and regulations for an [[ideal]] life (through such beliefs characterized by 'the [[god]](s) know what's best for us') morality is often confused with religious [[precept]]s. In secular communities, [[Lifestyle|lifestyle]] choices, which represent an [[individual]]'s conception of the good life, are often discussed in terms of \"morality\". Individuals sometimes feel that making an appropriate lifestyle choice invokes a true morality, and that accepted codes of conduct within their chosen community are fundamentally moral, even when such codes deviate from more general social principles. </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>The systematic study of morality is a branch of [[philosophy]] called [[ethics]].

A common meta-ethical question is of what is meant by the terms right or wrong. [[Moral realism]] would hold that the individual is attempting to elucidate some objective moral fact, whereas the various branches of [[moral non-realism]] would hold that morality is derived from either the norms of the prevalent society ([[cultural relativism]]), the edicts of a God ([[Divine Command Theory]]), is merely an expression of the speakers sentiments ([[emotivism]]), is an implied imperative ([[prescriptivism]]) or is literally nonsense ([[Error Theory]]).</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Development of morality ==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Development of morality ==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:71592533:newid:71787712 -->\n",
