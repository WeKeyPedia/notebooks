Such behaviours jeopardize our moral self-image; however, when we engage in immoral behaviours we still feel as though we are moral individuals.  ''Moral self-licensing'' attempts to explain this phenomenon and proposes that self-image security increases our likelihood to engage in immoral behaviour.   When our moral self image is threatened, we can gain confidence from our past moral behaviour.
