There are many types of religious morals. Modern [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and to a certain degree others such as [[Sikhism]], define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective gods and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith.
