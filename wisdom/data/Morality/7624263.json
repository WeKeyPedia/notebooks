There is the ingroup, which includes the individual himself/herself and those they believe to be of the same culture or race, and there is the outgroup, which are not entitled to the same level or type of morality. Some biologists, anthropologists and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] believe this ingroup/outgroup difference is an evolutionary mechanism which evolved for its enhanced survival aspects. Gary R. Johnson and V.S. Falger have argued that nationalism and patriotism are manipulated or misdirected forms of this built-in ingroup/outgroup boundary.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Morality in Juridical Systems==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Morality in Juridical Systems==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:7617519:newid:7624263 -->\n",
