In normative and universal sense morality refers to an ideal code of conduct, one which would be espoused in preference to alternatives by all rational people, under specified conditions. To deny 'morality' in this sense is a position known as [[moral skepticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-definition/ The Definition of Morality (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Morality is sometimes used as a synonym for [[ethics]], the systematic philosophical study of the moral domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophyblog.com.au/ethics-vs-morality-the-distinction-between-ethics-and-morals/ Ethics vs morality - the distinction between ethics and morals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics seeks to address questions such as how a moral outcome can be achieved in a specific situation ([[applied ethics]]), how moral values should be determined ([[normative ethics]]), what morals people actually abide by ([[descriptive ethics]]), what is the fundamental nature of ethics or morality itself, including whether it has any objective justification ([[meta-ethics]]), and how moral capacity or moral agency develops and what its nature is ([[moral psychology]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/ethics.htm Ethics [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In applied ethics, for example, the prohibition against taking human life is controversial with respect to [[capital punishment]], [[abortion]] and wars of [[invasion]]. In normative ethics, a typical question might be whether a lie told for the sake of protecting someone from harm is justified. In meta-ethics, a key issue is the meaning of the terms \"right\" or \"wrong\". [[Moral realism]] would hold that there are true moral statements which report objective moral facts, whereas moral [[anti-realism]] would hold that morality is derived from any one of the [[norm (sociology)|norms]] prevalent in society ([[cultural relativism]]); the edicts of a god ([[divine command theory]]); is merely an expression of the speakers' sentiments ([[emotivism]]); an implied imperative ([[prescriptive (philosophy)|prescriptive]]); falsely presupposes that there are objective moral facts ([[Moral nihilism|error theory]]). Some thinkers hold that there is no correct definition of right behavior, that morality can only be judged with respect to particular situations, within the standards of particular belief systems and socio-historical contexts. This position, known as [[moral relativism]], often cites empirical evidence from anthropology as evidence to support its claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/ Moral Relativism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite view, that there are universal, eternal moral truths is known as [[moral absolutism]]. Moral absolutists might concede that forces of social [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] significantly shape moral decisions, but deny that cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[convention (norm)|custom]]s define morally right behavior.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>== Religion as a source of moral authority ==</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>{{section-stub}}</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>{{Main|Divine command theory}}</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>{{Main|Divine command theory}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:210926747:newid:211292760 -->\n",
