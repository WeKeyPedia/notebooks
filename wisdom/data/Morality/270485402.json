This is especially dangerous when one immoral leader proclaims his or her personal edicts to be divine commands.  To the extent followers believe this claim, they may be exploited to perform immoral actions.</ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==See Also==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==See Also==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:270294344:newid:270485402 -->\n",
