A morality is put into effect through its influence on the society's general rules and formal codes&amp;mdash;especially penal codes and the determination of juridically correct conduct.  The fields in which the influence of morality is most commonly appreciated are [[Sexual morality|sex-related matters]], financial and professional conduct (with the notable example of [[deontology]]), and human relationships in general.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>A morality can be derived from many sources.  Very often, an individual's morality is influenced, to large degree, by [[religion]] or [[theology]], but other sources are also often cited, such as objective (natural) reality or political reality.  Religions typically hold that morality is not a human construct, but is the work of [[God]].  For example, in Judeo-Christian religions, one or another version of the [[Ten Commandments]] is held to have been issued directly to mankind by God.  Moreover, religions often hold that the human [[conscience]], the internal mechanism through which one senses the moral aspect of actions, is infused in mankind by God.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Many groups may, effectively, be distinguished by their morality, as a fundamental characteristic; in some cases, the common view on morality can be a basic factor of aggregation, as it happens in developed countries where the giantism of social structures causes (for other reasons) the need of building inside them sub-groups, identified by a common belief or view upon certain matters. This process, indeed, shows a similarity with the process of creation of political regroupements, and in fact sometimes the two fields (not always reciprocally) interfere.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>On a subjective level, morality is a system of personal ethical conduct that the individual imposes on himself or herself.  It is more concerned with individual choices, as a personal effect of [[free will]], rather than with dispute resolution or conflict, and does not seem to imply a relationship with other individuals or groups. This subjective self-regulation can also sometimes be derived from [[religion]] or [[theology]], but is also often seen as totally personal, unsharable, intuitive, creative and aesthetic (a \"[[moral core]]\").</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>The nature of morals themselves is often at issue between those who advocate shared morality or intuitive morality.  They may be seen as rules, or simply as examples drawn from stories.  Most sources of morality, e.g. the [[Bible]], include both, although it is usually clear that the rules drawn in the story itself are more important than those observed within it as examples.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>==Rebellion against morality==</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Moralities often include rules and regulations that do not have obvious reasons for existing, i.e., no immediate, immensely harmful results of transgression are apparent.  This is so because the harmful effects of such actions are largely indirect, but real nonetheless.  Thus, the need for the particular aspect of morality may be questioned. It is not unusual for rebellion against morality to occur, especially by the developing members of , much of which deals with the acceptance, in people, of positive aspects, and the rejection of negative ones.  Thus it can be argued that there may be a simple [[Darwinian]] explanation for the existence of religion: regardless of the truth or falsity of religious beliefs, religion tends to encourage morality, morality tends to encourage communality, and communality tends to assist survival.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Critics of this explanation say that it puts one in an impossible moral dilemma.
