Proponents of what could be called \"Natural Outgrowth Theory\" see no conflict between evolutionary biology and morality since moral codes generally prescribe behavior that enhances individual fitness and group well-being. For example, the taboo against [[inbreeding]] encourages individuals to avoid producing defective offspring that would depress their reproductive [[fitness]]. Compliance with and internalization of social conventions leads to a sense of regularity that makes group living more predictable and hence, less stressful, for its members. [[Reciprocity]] ensures a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. On any given night for [[vampire bat|vampire bats]], some individuals fail to feed on prey while others consume a surplus of blood. Bats that have successfully fed then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation.

A despotic [[dominance]] style like that observed in many [[macaque]] species also causes more stress for subordinates. As early hominids moved from arboreal to terrestrial habitats, anxiety-induced dispersal behavior would have exposed individuals to predation, forcing our ancestors to develop more efficient conflict management strategies if they were to enjoy the benefits of group living. The invention of stone tools around 2.5 million years ago made fights potentially more injurious, which further increased selection pressure for conflict interference and group controls on dominance behavior. In summary, living in close quarters on the open savanna with ready access to dangerous weapons compelled early hominids to develop strict codes of acceptable behavior. </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Christopher Boehm (1982) has advanced a possible mechanism where [[natural selection]] pressures drove the incremental development of moral complexity throughout [[<ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">Hominidae|</ins>hominid]] evolution.
