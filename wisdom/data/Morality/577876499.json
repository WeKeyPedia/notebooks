In a 2013 study by Seider, Novick, and Gomez, the effects of placing emphasis on moral character development or performance character development at three high-achieving, high-poverty, urban middle schools was examined. The authors defined performance character as being made up of the characteristics that allow individuals to control their thoughts in such a way which would encourage achievements, while moral character referred to the traits that were relevant to endeavouring for ethical conduct in interactions with the community and other individuals. It was discovered that students at a school which valued and emphasised moral character development by means of ethical philosophy programming had significantly higher integrity levels over a two-year period than did peers at a matched comparison school. On the other hand, individuals at the comparison schools which valued and placed more emphasis on character development showed significantly higher levels of community involvement and determination.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Morality and religion==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Morality and religion==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 117:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 114:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>=== Positions ===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>=== Positions ===</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Within the wide range of moral traditions, religious moral traditions co-exist with contemporary secular moral frameworks such as [[consequentialism]], [[freethought]], [[humanism]], [[utilitarianism]], and others.
