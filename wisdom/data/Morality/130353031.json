For example, if a person was concerned about what is &lt;br /&gt;[[morally]] right, then s/he would most likely not rob a bank. The actual definition of right behavior varies according to belief system. Religious belief systems usually include the idea of divine will and divine [[Last Judgment|judgment]] and usually correspond to a strict moral code of conduct.  The forms of honor associated with Medieval Christian [[chivalry|knighthood]] and the forms of dress associated with some sects of [[Islam]] are examples of this. Forces of social [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] also significantly shape moral decisions, although the effect of cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[convention (norm)|custom]]s on behavior does not address what morally right behavior is. </del></div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div><ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> kfiojeflekfrhefnfkijfh</ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Group morality develops from shared [[concept]]s and [[belief]]s and is often codified to regulate behavior within a [[culture]] or community.
