Some biologists, anthropologists and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] believe this in-group/out-group discrimination has evolved because it enhances group survival. This belief has been confirmed by simple computational models of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;T.R. Shultz, M. Hartshorn, and A. Kaznatcheev.
