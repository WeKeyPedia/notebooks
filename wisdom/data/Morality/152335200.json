Social Justice Research. &lt;/ref&gt;. According to this model, the conservatives would make their moral choices using five moral variables (harm, fairness, ingroup, authority, purity), whereas the liberals would use only two (harm, fairness). Haidt also declares that the origen of this division can be traced down to the way the tribal groups form, in contrast with the organization of the [[port]]-cities, where the cultural mix is greater, thus requiring more liberalism.
