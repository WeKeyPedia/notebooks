However, there are many types of religious morals as well. The [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and to a certain degree others such as [[Sikhism]], define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective gods and as interpreted by religious figures within the respective faith. [[Polytheistic]] religious traditions tend to diverge from this path. For example, within Buddhism, the intention of the individual and the circumstances should be accounted for to determine if an action is right or wrong.&lt;ref&gt; Peggy Morgan, \"Buddhism,\" in {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religioius Traditions |edition= Second|last1= Lawton|first1= Clive|authorlink1= |last2= Morgan|first2= Peggy |year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0748623303 |pages= 61, 88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; </ins>Many religions provide moral guidelines for their followers.
