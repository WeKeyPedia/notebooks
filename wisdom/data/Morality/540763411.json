This may be the philosophical view propounded by [[ethical naturalism|ethical naturalists]], however not all moral realists accept that position (e.g. [[ethical non-naturalism|ethical non-naturalists]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Chapouthier|Chapouthier, Georges]], To what extent is moral judgment natural ?, European Review (GB), 2004, Nr12(2), pp179-183&lt;/ref&gt;</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>* Moral [[anti-realism]], on the other hand, holds that moral statements either fail or do not even attempt to report objective moral facts.
