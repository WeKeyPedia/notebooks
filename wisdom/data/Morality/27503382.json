Religions typically hold that morality is not a human construct, but is the work of [[God]]. For example, in Judeo-Christian religions, one or another version of the [[Ten Commandments]] is held to have been issued directly to mankind by God. Moreover, religions often hold that the human [[conscience]], the internal mechanism through which one senses the moral aspect of actions, is infused in mankind by God. Non-religious individuals may justify morality on the basis of that improving the [[human condition]] or helping humanity is itself fundamentally 'good': they may aspire to base morality on [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian principles]] of reciprocal behavior and prevention of suffering or through 'objective' approaches, such as [[utilitarianism]].</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>For [[moral relativism|moral relativists]], morality is viewed as a system of personal ethical conduct that the individual imposes on himself or herself. With this view, it is more concerned with individual choices, as a personal effect of [[free will]], rather than with dispute resolution or conflict, and does not seem to imply a relationship with other individuals or groups. This subjective self-regulation can also sometimes be derived from [[religion]] or [[theology]], but is also often seen as totally personal, unsharable, intuitive, creative and aesthetic (a \"[[moral core]]\").</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Rational Morality==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Rational Morality==</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:27503106:newid:27503382 -->\n",
