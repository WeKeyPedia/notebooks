Its function is typically to ensure a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. For example, on any given night for [[vampire bat]]s, some individuals fail to feed on prey while others consume a surplus of blood. Bats that have successfully fed then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984)</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>It has been convincingly demonstrated that chimpanzees show empathy for each other in a wide variety of contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O’Connell |first= Sanjida |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1995|month= July|title= Empathy in chimpanzees: Evidence for theory of mind? |journal= primates|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 397–410|id= 0032-8332 |url= |accessdate= 2007-11-08 |quote=|doi= 10.1007/BF02382862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also possess the ability to engage in deception, and a level of social 'politics'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674356616 Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals].&lt;/ref&gt; prototypical of our own tendencies for [[gossip]] and [[reputation]] management.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>&lt;!-- [[hypocrisy]] Johnathan Haidt --&gt;</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Christopher Boehm (1982) has hypothesized that the incremental development of moral complexity throughout [[Great ape|hominid]] evolution was due to the increasing need to avoid disputes and injuries in moving to open savanna and developing stone weapons.
