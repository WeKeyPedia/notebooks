Its function is typically to ensure a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. For example, on any given night for vampire bats, some individuals fail to feed on prey while others consume a surplus of blood. Bats that have successfully fed then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984\"</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>COMMENT: BATS THAT HAVE EATEN HAVE FOOD ON THEIR MOUTHS, BATS THAT ARE HUNGRY TRY TO TAKE IT OR IT IS JUST A PART OF GROOMING BEHAVIOUR, OR THEY ARE VERY HUNGRY SO THEY TRY TO SNIFF THE FOOD WHICH IS ON THE OTHER BATS MOUTH, WHICH MAKES THE FULL BAT PUKE.
