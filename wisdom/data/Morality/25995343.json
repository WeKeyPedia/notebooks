For example, in Judeo-Christian religions, one or another version of the [[Ten Commandments]] is held to have been issued directly to mankind by God. Moreover, religions often hold that the human [[conscience]], the internal mechanism through which one senses the moral aspect of actions, is infused in mankind by God. Non-religious individuals may justify morality on the basis of that improving the [[human condition]] or helping humanity is itself fundamentally 'good': they may aspire to base morality on [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian principles]] of reciprocal behavior and prevention of suffering or through 'objective' approaches, such as [[utilitarianism]].</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>For [[moral relativism|moral relativists]], morality is viewed as a system of personal ethical conduct that the individual imposes on himself or herself.

Morality is \"rationally accepted\" and chosen. Rational morality asserts that all other \"views\" of morality are subjective and require some sort of sacrifice, either to the supernatural (i.e., God) or the social collective, whereas proper morality is self-evident and in the interest of the individual's happiness.

Viewholders counter that evolutionary psychology extends millions of years of [[empirical]] justification for our moral sense, provided that sense is indeed innate--more than recorded history could demonstrate.
