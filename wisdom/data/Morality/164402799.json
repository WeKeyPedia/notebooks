The problem is partly due to studies and disciplines being narrow and thus seeing morality as something which is separate; and partly due to the belief that social and economic justice cannot be furthered without a loss of economic efficiency.  This belief is challenged by [[binary economics]] which claims that it creates not only a new economics but also a new justice and a new morality because it is a market economics whose markets work for everybody rather than just a few; and it upholds private property but private property, again, for everybody rather than just a few.  A summary might be – a justice which creates efficiency and an efficiency which creates justice.  </div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Morality and politics==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Morality and politics==</div></td>\n</tr>\n",
