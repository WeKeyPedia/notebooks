The word 'ethics' is \"commonly used interchangeably with 'morality'&amp;nbsp;... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group, or individual.\"&lt;ref&gt;John Deigh in Robert Audi (ed), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, certain types of ethical theories, especially [[deontological ethics]], sometimes distinguish between 'ethics' and 'morals': \"Although the morality of people and their ethics amounts to the same thing, there is a usage that restricts morality to systems such as that of Kant, based on notions such as duty, obligation, and [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] of conduct, reserving ethics for the more [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] approach to practical reasoning, based on the notion of a [[virtue]], and generally avoiding the separation of 'moral' considerations from other practical considerations.\"&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of philosophy, 2008, p240&lt;/ref&gt; Although the words are often used as synonyms, morals are beliefs based on practices or teachings regarding how people conduct themselves in personal relationships and in society, while ethics refers to a set or system of principles, or a philosophy or theory behind them. When comparing morality with ethics, the word ethics is often used to refer to a philosophical analysis of a particular morality, especially when the formal definition is applied.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Descriptive and normative===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Descriptive and normative===</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:590272357:newid:590272523 -->\n",
