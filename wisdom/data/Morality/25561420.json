For many individuals, morality is influenced, to a large degree, not by [[religion]] or [[theology]], but other, secular, ethical codes are also followed.  Religions typically hold that morality is not a human construct, but is the work of [[God]].  For example, in Judeo-Christian religions, one or another version of the [[Ten Commandments]] is held to have been issued directly to mankind by God.  Moreover, religions often hold that the human [[conscience]], the internal mechanism through which one senses the moral aspect of actions, is infused in mankind by God. Non-religious individuals may justify morality on the basis of that improving the [[human condition]] or helping humanity is itself fundamentally 'good': they may aspire to base morality on [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian principles]] of reciprocal behaviour and prevention of suffering or through 'objective' approaches, such as [[utilitarianism]].</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>&lt;!-- Many groups may, effectively, be distinguished by their morality, as a fundamental characteristic; in some cases, the common view on morality can be a basic factor of aggregation, as it happens in developed countries where the complexity of social structures causes (for other reasons) the need of building inside them sub-groups, identified by a common belief or view upon certain matters.
