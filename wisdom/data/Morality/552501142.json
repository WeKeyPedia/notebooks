With the advent of cell phone many teens were engaging in promiscuous behavior. Of course the natural response to this was making sexting illegal and requiring teens who are caught register as sex offenders. What a society considers to immoral changes with our culture, and when polygamist and gamblers find themselves to be the target of scorn, we see legislators acting the part of the morality police. In the name of safety, Americans regularly react with laws that strip themselves of  the freedom they hold dear.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Group morality develops from shared [[concept]]s and [[belief]]s and is often codified to regulate behavior within a [[culture]] or community.
