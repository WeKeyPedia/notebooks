Such behaviours jeopardize our moral self-image; however, when we engage in immoral behaviours we still feel as though we are moral individuals.  ''Moral self-licensing'' attempts to explain this phenomenon and proposes that self-image security increases our likelihood to engage in immoral behaviour.   When our moral self image is threatened, we can gain confidence from our past moral behaviour. The more confident we are, the less we will worry about our future behaviour which actually increases the likelihood that we will engage in immoral behaviours. &lt;ref&gt;Monin, B, &amp; Miller, D.
