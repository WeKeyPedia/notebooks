For example, at the end of [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] about the tortoise and the hare, in which the plodding and determined tortoise wins a race against the much-faster yet debilitatingly arrogant hare, the moral is \"slow and steady wins the race.\"  Morals have long been included in [[children's literature]], perhaps because many of the stories written for children have been written for the purpose of teaching and guiding children, as opposed to entertaining them.  Many morals are even introduced with the phrase, \"The moral of the story is...\" to emphasize to the reader what the point of the episode was.  Morals have grown increasingly out of fashion in modern storytelling, and are now usually only included for [[irony|ironic]] purposes.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div> </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>See also: [[blue law]]s, [[sexual morality]], [[moral relativism]], [[moral absolutism]], [[moral universalism]], [[moral hazard]]</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>See also: [[blue law]]s, [[sexual morality]], [[moral relativism]], [[moral absolutism]], [[moral universalism]], [[moral hazard]]</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:2906410:newid:2906415 -->\n",
