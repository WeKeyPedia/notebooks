The term is often used to refer to a system of principles and judgments shared by [[cultural]], [[religion|religious]], [[secular]] (e.g. [[secular humanism|Humanist]]) and [[philosophical]] communities who share concepts and beliefs, by which people determine whether given actions are [[Goodness and value theory|right]] or [[evil|wrong]]. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div><del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">Thanks</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">for</del> <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">watching</del> the <del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">comment</del></div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div><ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">These</ins> <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">concepts</ins> <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">and beliefs about right and wrong are often generalized and codified by a culture or group, and thus serve to regulate</ins> the <ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\">behavior of its members.

Individuals who choose to conform in this way are popularly held to possess \"Moral Fibre\", whereas those who lack \"Moral Fibre\" may be labelled as socially [[degenerate]].

Since throughout most of human history, religions have provided both visions and regulations for an ideal life (through such beliefs characterized by 'the god(s) know what's best for us') morality is often confused with religious precepts. In secular situations morality can now be used in reference to such things as [[Lifestyle|lifestyle]] choices, as these tend to represent an individual's conception of a good life, and the individual usually conforms to a set of beliefs within the lifestyle's community of like-minded people. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>The systematic study of morality is a branch of [[philosophy]] called [[ethics]].

Do the terms \"good\", \"evil\", \"right\", and \"wrong\" make sense?
