Do the terms \"good\", \"evil\", \"right\", and \"wrong\" make sense?

Morality is \"rationally accepted\" and chosen. Rational morality asserts that all other \"views\" of morality are subjective and require some sort of sacrifice, either to the supernatural (i.e., God) or the social collective, whereas proper morality is self-evident and in the interest of the individual's happiness.

An innate tendency to develop a sense of right and wrong helps an individual to survive and reproduce in a  species with complex social interactions. Selected behaviors, seen in abstraction as [[moral code]]s, are seen to be common to all human cultures, and reflect, in their development, similarities to [[natural selection]] and these aspects of morality can be seen in as the basis of some [[religion|religious]] doctrine. From this, some also argue that there may be a simple [[Darwinian]] explanation for the existence of religion: that, regardless of the validity of religious beliefs, religion tends to encourage behavior beneficial to the species, as a code of morality tends to encourage communality, and communality tends to assist survival.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>These explanations for the existence of morality do not, however, necessarily assist in deciding what is truly ''right'' for future actions.

Viewholders counter that evolutionary psychology extends millions of years of [[empirical]] justification for our moral sense, provided that sense is indeed innate--more than recorded history could demonstrate. They claim sensible people would behave with morality knowing [[subconsciousness|subconsciously]] that it has succeeded in the past.
