An example of the descriptive usage could be \"common conceptions of morality have changed significantly over time.\"<ins class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> The arbitrariness of morality stems from the observation that actions that may be deemed moral in one culture in time may not be classified as such in others or in different time. The subjectiveness of morality is shown by the observation that actions or beliefs which by itself do not cause any harm may be by some considered immoral, e.g. marrying someone of same gender, being atheist, etc. Descriptive morality does not explain why something is immoral, only that it is. While for the most part immoral acts are classified as such because they cause harm, this is not by any means an all encompassing criterion. Many acts or beliefs are then classified as such because of prejudice, ignorance or hatred.      </ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>In its second, normative and universal sense, morality refers to an ideal code of conduct, one which would be espoused in preference to alternatives by<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> all</del> rational people, under specified conditions.
