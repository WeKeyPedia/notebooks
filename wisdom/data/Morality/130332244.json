They dictate proper [[personal conduct]]. Although some people might think that a moral code is simple, rarely is there anything simple about one's [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[ethics]], etc. or, for that matter, the judgment of those of others. The difficulty lies in the fact that morals are often part of a [[religion]] and more often than not about [[culture]] codes. Sometimes, moral codes give way to [[legal code]]s, which couple penalties or corrective actions with particular practices. Note that while many legal codes are merely built on a foundation of religious and/or cultural moral codes, ofttimes they are one and the same.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Examples of moral codes include the [[Ethics of reciprocity|Golden Rule]]; the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] of [[Buddhism]]; the ancient Egyptian code of [[Ma'at]] ;the [[Ten Commandments|ten commandments]] of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]; the [[yamas]] and [[niyama]] of the Hindu scriptures; the [[ten Indian commandments]]; and the principle of the [[Dessek]].</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Another related concept is the [[moral core]] which is assumed to be innate in each individual, to those who accept that differences between individuals are more important than posited Creators or their rules.
