When comparing morality with ethics, the word ethics is often used to refer to a philosophical analysis of particular morality, especially when formal definition is applied.</ins></div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Descriptive and normative===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>===Descriptive and normative===</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:544288459:newid:545662420 -->\n",
