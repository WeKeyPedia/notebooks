For example, on any given night for [[vampire bat]]s, some individuals fail to feed on prey while others consume a surplus of blood. Bats that have successfully fed then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984). </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>Christopher Boehm<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> could walk</del> (1982<del class=\"diffchange diffchange-inline\"> Bailey can't walk</del>) has hypothesized that the incremental development of moral complexity throughout [[Hominidae|hominid]] evolution was due to the increasing need to avoid disputes and injuries in moving to open savanna and developing stone weapons.
