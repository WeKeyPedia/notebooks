In its descriptive use, morals are arbitrarily and subjectively created by [[philosophy]], [[religion]], and/or individual [[conscience]].  An example of the descriptive usage could be \"common conceptions of morality have changed significantly over time.\" The arbitrariness of morality stems from the observation that actions that may be deemed moral in one culture in time may not be classified as such in others or in a different time. The subjectiveness of morality is shown by the observation that actions or beliefs which by themselves do not seem to cause overt harm may be considered immoral, e.g. marrying someone of the same or opposite gender, being an atheist or a theist, etc. Descriptive morality does not explain why any behavior should be considered right or wrong, only that it may be classified so. For the most part right and wrong acts are classified as such because they cause benefit or harm, respectively. However, this is not by any means an all encompassing criterion; it's possible that many moral beliefs are due to prejudice, ignorance or even hatred.</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>In its first, descriptive usage, ''morality'' means a [[code of conduct]] or a set of beliefs distinguishing between right and wrong behaviors.
