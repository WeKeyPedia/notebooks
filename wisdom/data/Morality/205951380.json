Moralism further holds the belief that there is only what can be proven, and therefore, while they do not deny God, they also do no believe in one. Like atheism however, Moralism stresses the study in science and appreciation of the earthly beauties help one accomplish a truly meaningful life.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>=== In-group and out-group ===</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>=== In-group and out-group ===</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:204955437:newid:205951380 -->\n",
