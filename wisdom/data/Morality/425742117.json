The Bible gives us different standard that we need to live by. We were given the ten commandments and were told to live by them. These are great moral to live by. In the New Testament we are given two testaments. These are two moral guide lines. There are sometimes people who just naturally have a good heart and that is great but most people who are not religious, and real practicing Christians do not have good morals. The Bible tells us a lot of how to live. We are told about sexual morality as well. We have to be married to have sex, and with the opposite sex. Many people who are homosexual claim that God made them the way they are. In the Bible it is against this, and says to change. If this is in the Bible than I don’t understand why they think the way they do. God can help you with any situation. We are to love all people, and are created equal in God. The in Acts 17, and Romans 10 tell us that people are equal. This is a great way to show morals. When you have morals you are not judgmental, you are fare, and think of people in a loving way. When you are a practicing Christian you are living the way that God intended us to. 1 Peter 2:17 tells us to love all people. Religion plays a big part in morality. We are all people striving to be great and when we live with morals we are living great. Morality is related with our actions and behaviors.(Morality By Design) Morals are very important to have. When you are a person of morals you are a more trusted person by others. </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Morality is linked to religion.

What would you do(Psychology Today) If we don’t have good and high morals the of course we would push people off of the ship. If we were to do so we would be selfish. If we have good high morals than we would just go on as we are or we ourselves would get off the boat.
