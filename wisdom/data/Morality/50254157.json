Conformity to such codification may also be called ''morality'', and the group may depend on widespread conformity to such codes for its continued existence. Individuals who choose to conform in this way are popularly held to possess \"Moral Fibre\", whereas those who lack \"Moral Fibre\" may be labelled as socially [[degenerate]]. A \"moral\" may refer to a particular principle, usually as an informal and general summary with respect to a moral principle, as it is applied in a given human situation.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Morality can thus also be seen as the collection of beliefs as to what constitutes a good life. Since throughout most of human history, religions have provided both visions and regulations for an ideal life (through such beliefs characterized by 'the god(s) know what's best for us') morality is often confused with religious precepts. In secular situations morality can now be used in reference to such things as [[Lifestyle|lifestyle]] choices, as these tend to represent an individual's conception of a good life, and the individual usually conforms to a set of beliefs within the lifestyle's community of like-minded people. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>The systematic study of morality is a branch of [[philosophy]] called [[ethics]]. Ethics seeks to address questions such as how one ought to behave in a specific situation (\"[[applied ethics]]\"), how one can justify a moral position (\"[[normative ethics]]\"), and how one should understand the fundamental nature of ethics or morality itself, including whether it has any objective justification (\"[[meta-ethics]]\").</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>For example, in applied ethics, the question of [[abortion]] being morally permissible is a current issue in [[United States]] society and politics.

Do the terms \"good\", \"evil\", \"right\", and \"wrong\" make sense?
