So their own view on what ought to be treated as 'moral' or 'immoral' may not be automatically correct. Often there is room for argument about what human society needs to treat as right or wrong in its own best interests (e.g. on issues such as homosexuality; abortion; the death penalty; suicide; taxation for particular causes; and so on).</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">−</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>'Ought' we to live in moral ways?
