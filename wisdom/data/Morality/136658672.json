One approach argues that moral codes are founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were naturally selected in the past because they aided survival and reproduction ([[inclusive fitness]]), and that they still generally prescribe behavior that enhances individual fitness and/or group well-being. Selected psychological and behavioral tendencies, and their abstraction in to moral codes or religions, are seen to be common to most or all human cultures. For example, the near-universal taboo against [[inbreeding]] encourages individuals to avoid producing defective offspring. [[Reciprocity]] ensures a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. For example, on any given night for [[vampire bat]]s, some individuals fail to feed on prey while others consume a surplus of blood. Bats that have successfully fed then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984). </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>While some philosophers, psychologists and evolutionary biologists hold that morality is a thin crust hiding [[egoism]], [[amorality]], and anti-social tendencies, others see morality as equally a product of evolutionary forces and as evidence for continuity with other group-living organisms[http://www.amazon.com/Good-Natured-Origins-Humans-Animals/dp/0674356616].
