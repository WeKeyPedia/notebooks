We know of no species sufficiently unlike humans and sufficiently intelligent to test this idea properly, but the nearest we can come to it is the [[octopus]].  This is a kind of [[mollusc]], related to clams and snails, but it is remarkably intelligent.  In experiments, octopuses have solved problems that require quite sophisticated abstract reasoning.  Their life-cycle is very different from our own, however.  In particular, their strategy for ensuring the survival of their offspring is not to care for their children, but to have hundreds of thousands of them at once, the sheer weight of numbers ensuring that by chance some will avoid being eaten and will grow to adulthood.  The mother dies shortly after giving birth.  Now, let us suppose that there existed some kind of super-octopus whose intelligence was comparable to humans.  Would this creature have a sense of right and wrong?   There doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be any logical reason to think that it wouldn&amp;#8217;t.  But there is reason to suppose that their morality would be quite different from our own.  They would be unlikely to share our revulsion for infanticide, but would probably have an entirely different set of instinctive taboos and moral codes. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>---- </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>---- </div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:version:1.11a:oldid:120457:newid:120466 -->\n",
