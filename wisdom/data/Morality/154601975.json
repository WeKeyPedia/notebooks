On this view, moral codes are founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were selected for in the past because they aided survival and reproduction ([[inclusive fitness]]).  As an example, the near-universal taboo against [[inbreeding]] is explained as a means to avoid producing defective offspring. Christopher Boehm (1982) has hypothesized that the incremental development of moral complexity throughout [[Hominidae|hominid]] evolution was due to the increasing need to avoid disputes and injuries in moving to open savanna and developing stone weapons. Other theories are that increasing complexity was simply a correlate of increasing group size and brain size, and in particular  the development of [[theory of mind]] abilities. </div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>Evolutionary biologists start from the assumption that morality is essentially a product of evolutionary forces.
