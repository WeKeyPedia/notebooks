Ellwood, Jr.</a>, was the first mainstream political leader to take deliberate steps to change American health care from its longstanding not-for-profit business principles into a for-profit model that would be driven by the insurance industry. In 1973, Congress passed the <a href=\"/wiki/Health_Maintenance_Organization_Act_of_1973\" title=\"Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973\">Health Maintenance Organization Act</a>, which encouraged rapid growth of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), the first form of managed care.\n</p><p>Managed care plans are widely credited with subduing medical cost inflation in the late 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers to discount their rates, and causing the health-care industry to become more efficient and competitive. Managed care plans and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts created widespread perception that they were more interested in saving money than providing health care.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nation.27s_Business_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nation.27s_Business-3\"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In a 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those polled said they believed that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who are sick to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>\n</p><p>The backlash included vocal critics, including disgruntled patients and consumer-advocacy groups, who argued that managed care plans were controlling costs by denying medically necessary services to patients, even in life-threatening situations, or by providing low-quality care.

This can be achieved by changing the focus of care and social services away from the ultra-specialized, evidence based concept to a highly tuned, flexible and technically advanced primary care system.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Health_Maintenance_Organization:_.28HMO.29\">Health Maintenance Organization: (HMO)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Health Maintenance Organization: (HMO)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Proposed in the 1960s by Dr. Paul Elwood in the \"Health Maintenance Strategy\", the <a href=\"/wiki/HMO\" title=\"HMO\" class=\"mw-redirect\">HMO</a> concept was promoted by the <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_M._Nixon\" title=\"Richard M. Nixon\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Nixon Administration</a> as a fix to rising health care costs and set in law as the <a href=\"/wiki/Health_Maintenance_Organization_Act_of_1973\" title=\"Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973\">Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973</a>. As defined in the act, a federally qualified HMO would in exchange for a subscriber fee (premium) allow members access to a panel of employed <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_doctor\" title=\"Medical doctor\" class=\"mw-redirect\">physicians</a> or a network of doctors and facilities including <a href=\"/wiki/Hospital\" title=\"Hospital\">hospitals</a>. In return the HMO received mandated market access and could receive federal development funds.\n</p><p>HMOs are licensed at the state level, under a license that is known as a certificate of authority (COA) rather than under an insurance license.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1972, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted the HMO Model Act, which was intended to provide a model regulatory structure for states to use in authorizing the establishment of HMOs and in monitoring their operations.  In practice, an HMO is a coordinated delivery system that combines both the financing and delivery of health care for enrollees. In the design of the plan, each member is assigned a \"gatekeeper\", a <a href=\"/wiki/Primary_care_physician\" title=\"Primary care physician\">primary care physician</a> (PCP) who is responsible for the overall care of members assigned to him/her. Specialty services require a specific referral from the PCP to the specialist. Non-emergency hospital admissions also required specific pre-authorization by the PCP. Typically, services are not covered if performed by a provider not an employee of or specifically approved by the HMO, unless it is an emergency situation as defined by the HMO. Financial sanctions for use of emergency facilities in non-emergent situations were once an issue; however, prudent layperson language now applies to all emergency-service utilization and penalties are rare.\n</p><p>Since the 1980s, under the <a href=\"/wiki/ERISA\" title=\"ERISA\" class=\"mw-redirect\">ERISA</a> Act passed in Congress in 1974 and its <a href=\"/wiki/Federal_preemption\" title=\"Federal preemption\">preemptive</a> effect on state common law tort lawsuits that \"relate to\" Employee Benefit Plans, HMOs administering benefits through private employer health plans have been protected by Federal law from <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_malpractice\" title=\"Medical malpractice\">malpractice litigation</a> on the grounds that the decisions regarding patient care are administrative rather than medical in nature.

Most often, the physicians are paid on a basis of <a href=\"/wiki/Capitation_(healthcare)\" title=\"Capitation (healthcare)\">capitation</a>, which in this context means a set amount for each enrolled person assigned to that physician or group of physicians, whether or not that person seeks care. The contract is not usually exclusive, allowing individual doctors or the group to sign contracts with multiple HMOs. Physicians who participate in IPAs usually also serve <a href=\"/wiki/Fee-for-service\" title=\"Fee-for-service\">fee-for-service</a> patients not associated with managed care.\n</p><p>IPAs usually have a governing board to determine the best forms of practices.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Preferred_Provider_Organization_.28PPO.29\">Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Preferred_provider_organization\" title=\"Preferred provider organization\">Preferred provider organization</a></div>\n<p>Rather than contract with the various insurers and third party administrators, providers may contract with preferred provider organizations. A membership allows a substantial discount below their regularly charged rates from the designated professionals partnered with the organization. Preferred provider organizations themselves earn money by charging an access fee to the insurance company for the use of their network (unlike the usual insurance with premiums and corresponding payments paid either in full or partially by the insurance provider to the medical doctor).\n</p><p>In terms of using such a plan, unlike an HMO plan, which has a copayment cost share feature (a nominal payment generally paid at the time of service), a PPO generally does not have a copay and instead offers a deductible and a coinsurance feature. The deductible must be paid in full before any benefits are provided. After the deductible is met, the coinsurance benefits apply. If the PPO plan is an 80% coinsurance plan with a $1,000 deductible, then the patient will pay 100% of the allowed provider fee up to $1,000. After this amount has been paid by the patient, the insurer will pay 80% of subsequent fees and the patient will pay the remaining 20%.  Charges above the allowed amount are not payable by the patient or insurer but instead are written off as a discount by the physician.\n</p><p>Because the patient is picking up a substantial portion of the \"first dollars\" of coverage, PPO are the least expensive types of coverage <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.kff.org/insurance/7527/upload/7527.pdf\">[1]</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Point_Of_Service_.28POS.29\">Point Of Service (POS)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Point Of Service (POS)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Point_of_service_plan\" title=\"Point of service plan\">Point of service plan</a></div>\n<p>A POS plan utilizes some of the features of each of the above plans. Members of a POS plan do not make a choice about which system to use until the point at which the service is being used.\n</p><p>In terms of using such a plan, a POS plan has levels of progressively higher patient financial participation as the patient moves away from the more managed features of the plan. For example, if the patient stays in a network of providers and seeks a referral to use a specialist, they may have a copayment only. However, if they use an out of network provider, but do not seek a referral, they will pay more, and so on.\n</p><p>POS plans are becoming more popular because they offer more flexibility and freedom of choice than standard HMOs.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Private_Fee-For-Service_.28PFFS.29\">Private Fee-For-Service (PFFS)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Private Fee-For-Service (PFFS)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There are basically two types of Health Insurance: Fee-for-Service (Indemnity) and Managed Care. Health Insurance policies may vary from low cost to all-inclusive, meeting different demands of customers. Which Health Insurance type and plan you choose largely depends on your needs, preferences and budget. Fee-for-Service is a traditional kind of health care policy wherein insurance companies pay medical staff fees for each service provided to an insured patient. Fee-for-service plans offer a wide choice of doctors and hospitals.\n</p><p>Fee-for-Service coverage falls into Basic and Major Medical Protection categories. Basic protection deals with costs of a hospital room, hospital services, care and supplies, cost of surgery in or out of hospital, and doctor visits. Major Medical Protection covers costs of serious illnesses and injuries, which usually require long-term treatment and rehabilitation period. Basic and Major Medical Insurance coverage combined are called a Comprehensive Health Care Plan. It is vitally important to know your insurance policy, since some services can be limited and some not covered at all.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Managed_care_in_indemnity_insurance_plans\">Managed care in indemnity insurance plans</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Managed care in indemnity insurance plans\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Many \"traditional\" or \"<a href=\"/wiki/Insurance#Indemnification\" title=\"Insurance\">indemnity</a>\" health insurance plans now incorporate some managed care features such as precertification for non-emergency hospital admissions and utilization reviews.  These are sometimes described as \"managed indemnity\" plans.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Impacts\">Impacts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Impacts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The overall impact of managed care remains widely debated. Proponents argue that it has increased efficiency, improved overall standards, and led to a better understanding of the relationship between costs and quality. They argue that there is no consistent, direct correlation between the cost of care and its quality, pointing to a 2002 Juran Institute study which estimated that the \"cost of poor quality\" caused by overuse, misuse, and waste amounts to 30 percent of all direct health care spending.<sup id=\"cite_ref-PWC_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PWC-6\"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The emerging practice of <a href=\"/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine\" title=\"Evidence-based medicine\">evidence-based medicine</a> is being used to determine when lower-cost medicine may in fact be more effective.\n</p><p>Critics of managed care argue that \"for-profit\" managed care has been an unsuccessful health policy, as it has contributed to higher health care costs (25\u201333% higher overhead at some of the largest HMOs), increased the number of uninsured citizens, driven away health care providers, and applied downward pressure on quality (worse scores on 14 of 14 quality indicators reported to the National Committee for Quality Assurance).<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>\n</p><p>The most common managed care financial arrangement, <a href=\"/wiki/Capitation_(healthcare)\" title=\"Capitation (healthcare)\">capitation</a>, places health care providers in the role of micro-health insurers, assuming the responsibility for managing the unknown future health care costs of their patients. Small insurers, like individual consumers, tend to have annual costs that fluctuate far more than larger insurers. The term \"Professional Caregiver Insurance Risk<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://drtcbear.servebbs.net:81/~PCIR/\">[2]</a> explains the inefficiencies in health care finance that result when insurance risks are inefficiently transferred to health care providers who are expected to <a href=\"/wiki/Capitated_reimbursement\" title=\"Capitated reimbursement\" class=\"mw-redirect\">cover such costs</a> in return for their capitation payments. As Cox (2006) demonstrates, providers cannot be adequately compensated for their insurance risks without forcing managed care organizations to become price uncompetitive vis-a-vis risk retaining insurers. Cox (2010) <sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> shows that smaller insurers have lower probabilities of modest profits than large insurers, higher probabilities of high losses than large insurers, provide lower benefits to policyholders, and have far higher surplus requirements. All these effects work against the viability of health care provider insurance risk assumption.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li> <a href=\"/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Health care in the United States\">Health care in the United States</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"/wiki/Health_insurance_in_the_United_States\" title=\"Health insurance in the United States\">Health insurance in the United States</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"/wiki/Independent_medical_review\" title=\"Independent medical review\">Independent medical review</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"/wiki/Medical_care_ratio\" title=\"Medical care ratio\">Medical care ratio</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"/wiki/URAC\" title=\"URAC\">URAC</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_and_references\">Notes and references</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Managed_care&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Notes and references\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=managed%20care\">Managed Care Programs</a>.
