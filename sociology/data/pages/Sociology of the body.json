Laqueur\">Thomas Laqueur</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> prior to the eighteenth century the predominant model for a social understanding of the body was the \"<a href=\"/wiki/One_sex_two_sex_theory\" title=\"One sex two sex theory\">one sex model/one flesh model</a>\". It followed that there was one model of the body which differed between the sexes and races, for example, the vagina was simply seen as a weaker version of the penis and even thought to emit sperm.\n</p><p>This was changed by <a href=\"/wiki/The_Enlightenment\" title=\"The Enlightenment\" class=\"mw-redirect\">the Enlightenment</a>. In the sixteenth century, Europe began to participate in the <a href=\"/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade\" title=\"Atlantic slave trade\">slave trade</a> and in order to justify this a large quantity of literature was produced showing the deviant <a href=\"/wiki/Human_sexual_behavior\" title=\"Human sexual behavior\" class=\"mw-redirect\">sexuality</a> and savagery of the African (<a href=\"/wiki/Frantz_Fanon\" title=\"Frantz Fanon\">Fanon</a>, 1976). In the eighteenth century, the ideas of <a href=\"/wiki/Egalitarianism\" title=\"Egalitarianism\">egalitarianism</a> and universal and inalienable rights were becoming the intellectual norm. However, they could not justify the subordination of women within this theory.\n</p><p>To explain these the <i>biology of <a href=\"/wiki/Commensurability_(philosophy_of_science)\" title=\"Commensurability (philosophy of science)\">incommensurability</a></i> was created. This essentially claimed that different sexes and races were better adjusted for different tasks and could therefore show the necessity of discrimination and subordination. For example, <a href=\"/wiki/Craniometry\" title=\"Craniometry\">craniometry</a> was used to show people of African descent to be less evolved than those of European descent (<a href=\"/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould\" title=\"Stephen Jay Gould\">Gould</a>, 1981).\n</p><p>This was also combined with the technological developments which were taking place, leading to people seeing the body as a machine and therefore understandable, classifiable and repairable, one of the first examples of this was the work of <a href=\"/wiki/William_Harvey\" title=\"William Harvey\">William Harvey</a> in the early seventeenth century.\n</p><p>Another early key area of development was the <a href=\"/wiki/Descartes\" title=\"Descartes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Cartesian</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Mind-body_dichotomy\" title=\"Mind-body dichotomy\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Dichotomy</a>. This saw the mind and the body as separated and led to the principle of interaction between the two being an accepted theory on the body until the development of the <a href=\"/wiki/Structuralism_(psychology)\" title=\"Structuralism (psychology)\">Structuralist</a> approach in the twentieth century.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_importance_of_studying_the_body_in_the_Sociology_of_health_and_illness\">The importance of studying the body in the Sociology of health and illness</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sociology_of_the_body&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The importance of studying the body in the Sociology of health and illness\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Especially important within the sociology of the body tradition is the sociology of health and illness. This is because illness may obviously reduce the level of normal functioning of the body. Also, increasingly people in society believe that illness is prevented by fulfilling activities leading to a healthy body (thus changing one's lifestyle) such as dieting and exercise, as well as avoiding anything that can cause damage to the body, like smoking. Moreover, medical science is now able to alter our bodies through plastic surgery, transplanting organs, reproductive aids and even change in an unborn baby's genetic structure.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Historical_sociology_of_body_and_physical_practices\">Historical sociology of body and physical practices</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sociology_of_the_body&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Historical sociology of body and physical practices\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In France a lot of researchers have been working on this topic.

At one end of the spectrum there are eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia and on the other end there is growing epidemic of obesity especially in the US. Both ideals have increased widely over the last few decades due in part to growing mass media coverage in which there are norms within society and the always growing pressure to either look and feel a certain way.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Anorexia, a disorder often defined as a \u201cmarkedly reduced appetite or total aversion to food\u201d (Definition of Anorexia, 2003).<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Often along with excessive exercise this is the one disorder that has led to the large increase in overly thin individuals. Along with anorexia, bulimia, \u201ca disorder that can be defined as episodes of secretive excessive eating (binge-eating) followed by inappropriate methods of weight control, such as self-induced vomiting (purging), abuse of laxatives and diuretics, or excessive exercise\u201d has also been an increased method used by individuals all over the world in the fight to remain sometimes deadly thin (Definition of Bulimia 2003).<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Both disorders are rooted in feelings of shame and desire to have control over one's body (Giddens, Duneier, Appelbaum, and Carr 2009).<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The individual feels inadequate and imperfect. They may have anxieties about how others perceive them which becomes a focus on feelings about their body. At that point, shedding weight becomes the means of making everything right in their world. The fact that we have a strong personal independence over our bodies in the past presents us with positive possibilities as well as new anxieties and problems (Giddens, Duneier, Appelbaum, and Carr  2009).<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></li></ul>\n<ul><li>This idea is what sociologists call \"socialization of nature\", which is a phenomenon that used to be \"natural\", or given in nature, and have now become social and depend on our social decisions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Obesity, the state of being well above one's normal weight, has become the other end of the distorted ideas about body image (Definition of obesity, 2001).<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> According to the Centers for Disease Control, roughly 60 percent of adult Americans are now over weight, and an estimated 6.5 percent of American children ages six to eleven along with 5 percent of ages twelve to nineteen are overweight (Giddens, Duneier, Appelbaum, and Carr 2009).<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Reasons thought to be behind obesity vary widely and are often debated.
