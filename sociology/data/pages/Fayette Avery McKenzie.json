Shedd travelled to New York City to meet with a variety of Fisk stakeholders, including the Carnegie Foundation, officers of the American Missionary Association, academics from Cornell University (all of whom were friends with Booker T.

Washington believed Shedd was \u201cthe best man we can get for the presidency of Fisk University,\u201d  but warned of opposition by Fisk alumni and the Nashville Black community who wanted a Black president. He also predicted and a stormy period of two or three years for Shedd and his family to acclimate to the unique conditions of the South. Washington observed most Northerners \u201cmake the mistake of expressing opinions before they have had time to get into the local atmosphere of the community, or of the South.\u201d Shedd \u201cought to be cautioned not to be too ready with opinions concerning either Fisk or Southern conditions.\u201d\n</p><p>In November 1914, after the visits to Nashville and Tuskegee, Shedd asked that his name be removed his name from consideration for the position, and sent a ten page report to Wallace Buttrick at the General Education Board. Shedd\u2019s report was a windfall for the Board of Trustees and the General Education Board and provided a professional educator\u2019s candid assessment of the challenges awaiting the next President of Fisk. Shedd observed, \u201dThe work of Fisk University was begun and has been carried on in an atmosphere of social ostracism and isolation, and while the white man in Tennessee is as liberal toward his black fellow-citizens as any where in the South, still this liberal spirit has yet amounted to very little. In fact, I am inclined to believe that the colored members of this faculty have a far more normal life than do their white colleagues. While I cannot say the sense of social isolation, which has compelled all the children of the faculty to be sent north for an education, and in some cases has compelled the wives of the professors to live in the North for the sake of the children has affected the efficiency of the work of  the faculty, still this condition must be recorded and deeply regretted.\u201d Shedd also met with Tennessee Governor <a href=\"/wiki/Ben_W._Hooper\" title=\"Ben W. Hooper\">Ben W. Hooper</a> while visiting Fisk. The meeting raised further questions in Shedd\u2019s mind, as the Governor expressed doubt  \u201cas to whether Fisk could really do for the colored man what Vanderbilt was and is doing for the white\u201d and \u201cdoubt as to whether for some time to come financial support could be gained in the South for the institution.\u201d While at Tuskegee, Shedd met and spoke with <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_E._Park\" title=\"Robert E. Park\">Robert E. Park</a>, a prominent sociologist who was advisor to Booker T. Washington at Tuskegee. Shedd reported Park\u2019s critique of Fisk. Park believed the  \u201cfundamental basis for race discrimination, which is part of the Fisk problem, lies in the acceptance by it and for it of lower standards,\u201d or, in other words, that  \u201cthe white, and from him, the colored man has accepted lower standards for the colored man than for the white man.\u201d   For Park, the remedy was to raise the scholastic standard to the level of the best collegiate institutions of the country. Shedd also reported that Nashville was ready to cooperate with the North in development of Fisk University as a first rate institution, and that fund raising was essential to place Fisk \u201cbeyond the necessity of anxiety.\u201d Shedd did not disclose specific reasons for removing his name from consideration, but his lengthy report suggests he was \u201crather staggered with its difficulties and responsibilities\u201d of the President of Fisk.<sup id=\"cite_ref-41\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-41\"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\".22In_the_line_of_fire.22\">\"In the line of fire\"</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fayette_Avery_McKenzie&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: &quot;In the line of fire&quot;\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>McKenzie was recommended for the Fisk presidency by his friend and colleague Thomas Jesse Jones, now director of the <a href=\"/wiki/Phelps-Stokes_Fund\" title=\"Phelps-Stokes Fund\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Phelps-Stokes Fund</a> and a Fisk trustee.

College was a time to study, not to engage in frivolous activities, and organizations and activities that promoted elitism among students did not belong on Fisk\u2019s campus. In 1915, Fisk officials debated the issue and agreed to ban \u201cfraternities and other secret or oath-bound societies\u201d because the trustees believed such organizations did not reflect the democratic ideals taught at the University and could lead to inappropriate student conduct.

The Student Army Training Corp allowed students to attend school while they participated in military training exercises during World War I. McKenzie noted that accommodating the troops, \"will cramp us very considerably, but the compensation will keep us from any additional indebtedness and probably turn our lodging and boarding department into a self-supporting institution, and enable us to make a number of necessary changes or improvements without cutting into our normal funds. I am glad, too, to be of very direct service to the nation in its persecution of the War.\u201d In August 1918, the first of over 600 Black SATC cadets arrived in Nashville. \u201cThe boys will live a highly educational military life, centered about Bennett Hall. The girls will live an equally efficient, busy school life, centered about Jubilee Hall,\u201d he stated. However the presence of military cadets on Fisk\u2019s campus, all of whom were young men, added to the University\u2019s disciplinary problems. While McKenzie appreciated the disciplinary focus of the military\u2019s proscribed daily routine, he harshly criticized the military\u2019s refusal to acknowledge and abide by Fisk\u2019s rules and regulations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nicholson.2C_p.227-228_71-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nicholson.2C_p.227-228-71\"><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup> At the opening of the 1918 academic year, McKenzie set the tone for a new approach to student conduct by invoking the military\u2019s presence and influence on the campus, \"We are a military institution. Not that we have been absorbed by the military, but that the essential principles of efficiency exemplified in the military have been absorbed into the university. These principles include concentration of effort, unremitting toil, elimination of all unnecessary activities and motions, regular and insistent schedule of life, promptness, accuracy, reliability thoroughness, instant and complete obedience. With military leaders unwilling to enforce \u201csatisfactory moral standards,\u201d their cadets ran rampant, smoking, cursing, and fraternizing with Fisk co-eds. In one significant infraction, a soldier helped a female Fisk student to \u201cescape supervision\u201d of the University and was found with her in a private room. Although the man was arrested, the military administered no punishment. In addition to the poor behavior of cadets, McKenzie strongly criticized the federal government for failing to provide Black soldiers adequate compensation for their service to the nation. \u201cWhen the immediate aim of efficient fighters was no longer its aim, the Government sought to free itself from its financial obligations and forgot what havoc it would work in the lives of many, many young men,\u201d  McKenzie lamented in the <i>Fisk News</i>. While the mobilization effort only lasted a few months and World War I ended in November 1918, the military presence had lasting effects on Fisk\u2019s campus school discipline. McKenzie continued to experiment the military\u2019s model of conduct, but the continued military discipline for student conduct policies after the military\u2019s departure from campus angered Fisk students. Viewing the new policies as infringing on their rights, several Fisk students rebelled.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nicholson.2C_p.227-228_71-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nicholson.2C_p.227-228-71\"><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup> McKenzie reported, \"The other day the college boys served notice on me that until I was inclined to treat them like men they would refuse to attend the study hall.

Since then, one or more of them have attempted to spoil the lights in the study hall, and they have torn down the picture of President Cravath and written an ugly message on the chapel wall where the picture was. McKenzie noted the required study hall also angered certain Fisk alumni, remarking  \u201cOnly last night I was sent almost direct word to the effect that the alumni would protest against the study hall, and a reminder of the fact that practically no white man is trusted by any Negro.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-Nicholson.2C_p.227-228_71-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nicholson.2C_p.227-228-71\"><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sports_at_Fisk\">Sports at Fisk</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fayette_Avery_McKenzie&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Sports at Fisk\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Howard-Fisk_Football_Game,_1919.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/Howard-Fisk_Football_Game%2C_1919.png/250px-Howard-Fisk_Football_Game%2C_1919.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/Howard-Fisk_Football_Game%2C_1919.png/375px-Howard-Fisk_Football_Game%2C_1919.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/Howard-Fisk_Football_Game%2C_1919.png/500px-Howard-Fisk_Football_Game%2C_1919.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"616\" data-file-height=\"354\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Howard-Fisk_Football_Game,_1919.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Waiting for the start of the Fisk-Howard Football Game, 1919.</div></div></div>\n<p>In the 1910s, college sports began to capture broad American interest, and Fisk students started agitating for greater opportunities to participate in intercollegiate athletics. Because of the additional responsibility related to hosting on campus hundreds of military troops, difficulties in raising money, and the lack of an instructor in physical education, McKenzie eliminated most Fisk intercollegiate athletic teams in 1918, but reinstated them in 1919. Despite generally strong athletic teams, Fisk\u2019s football team was self-proclaimed the \u201cchampions of the South\u201d in 1919, Fisk officials remained apprehensive about intercollegiate athletics, and Fisk students complained about the lack of an athletic conference affiliation.

McKenzie viewed excess in intercollegiate athletics as another example of an activity incompatible with the academics he wished to create at Fisk. Fearful that Black colleges would endure \u201cthe whole disgraceful career of White athletics, McKenzie resisted student and alumni demands to expand Fisk\u2019s intercollegiate programs during his administration. In recounting a Fisk football game, McKenzie took greater pleasure in how Fisk\u2019s players conducted themselves after the contest than their performance on the field. \"We lost the game with <a href=\"/wiki/Morehouse_College\" title=\"Morehouse College\">Morehouse College</a> on Thanksgiving Day with a score of six to nothing on a very watery field, but our students proved true sportsmen and were exceedingly courteous of the team after the game and permitted them to light the bonfire which was prepared for celebration that night.\"\n</p><p>Events in late 1921 provided a stark example of the corrupting influences associated with intercollegiate sports, and galvanized Fisk faculty support of ending Fisk\u2019s intercollegiate athletic programs. After Fisk\u2019s football team claimed victory over <a href=\"/wiki/Wilberforce_University\" title=\"Wilberforce University\">Wilberforce College</a>, the defeated team\u2019s players issued a statement picked up by the <i>Chicago Defender</i> claiming the officiating was unfair, and Wilberforce deserved to win the game. The players further accused Fisk of being \u201cinhospitable and discourteous\u201d during their time on campus. On their return train to Louisville, Fisk team members created a disturbance that resulted in several players\u2019 arrests and fines of $150 to cover damages. McKenzie later learned Wilberforce contacted a Fisk player not allowed to play in the game, offered him a free education if he attended Wilberforce, and the student subsequently transferred. Shortly after the Wilberforce incident, Professor <a href=\"/wiki/John_Wesley_Work_III\" title=\"John Wesley Work III\">John W. Work</a>, who oversaw Fisk\u2019s Jubilee Singers, told McKenzie he thought \u201cstudents were too crazy over football,\u201d and he \u201cwould openly advocate the taking away entirely of intercollegiate athletics.\u201d  Another Fisk faculty member suggested that \u201cintramural athletics were the only kind to encourage,\u201d and immediately called a meeting of the athletic committee to discuss whether Fisk should continue offering intercollegiate athletics. Although several faculty wanted to eliminate Fisk\u2019s sports programs, McKenzie never pursued such action. Still, concerned about the unsavory influence of intercollegiate athletics at Fisk, McKenzie mandated that athletes receive no special treatment, and he prohibited athletic scholarships. McKenzie also urged the board of trustees to require all athletes complete one year of study and maintain sufficient academic progress prior to their participation in intercollegiate athletics, an idea that in later decades was adopted by most White and Black colleges.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"One_Million_Dollar_Campaign\">One Million Dollar Campaign</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fayette_Avery_McKenzie&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: One Million Dollar Campaign\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Dr._F.A._McKenzie,_President_of_Fisk_University.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a5/Dr._F.A._McKenzie%2C_President_of_Fisk_University.png/250px-Dr._F.A._McKenzie%2C_President_of_Fisk_University.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"220\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a5/Dr._F.A._McKenzie%2C_President_of_Fisk_University.png/375px-Dr._F.A._McKenzie%2C_President_of_Fisk_University.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/Dr._F.A._McKenzie%2C_President_of_Fisk_University.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"445\" data-file-height=\"392\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Dr._F.A._McKenzie,_President_of_Fisk_University.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Dr. Fayette Avery McKenzie at his desk. c.1920</div></div></div>\n<p>In late 1919, the Fisk experiment was energized when Rosenwald donated $50&#160;Million to the General Education Board for management.

With U.S. entry into the War on April 16, 1917, the military draft depleted the labor pool even further. Lured by manufacturing jobs and the promise of a better life in the North, Blacks began a massive migration to Northern industrial centers, and by 1920 over 300,000 had relocated to Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, and Cleveland. The sudden exodus of their labor pool, and therefore their economic security, sent alarm throughout White communities in the South. Whites in the North reacted with similar consternation over the influx of Blacks into their cities. Southern White anger over increasing race assertiveness of Blacks, and Northern White concerns about Black migration, led to more virulent racism and frequent outbreaks of racial violence. After the War ended on November 11, 1918, the tense atmosphere exploded during the summer of 1919.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nicholson.2C_p.264_74-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nicholson.2C_p.264-74\"><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup> On April 2, 1917, the United States declared war on Germany, ushering a period of social, racial, and political turbulence.\nThe presence of 600 Black ROTC cadets on Fisk\u2019s campus during fall 1918 contributed to an increase in student misconduct. Unease over the waves of immigrants coming to the United States, growing labor unrest in America\u2019s industrial centers, U.S. entrance into World War I, and strong anti-communist sentiment fueled by the Russian Revolution heightened Americans\u2019 anxiety and discouraged dissent.\nOn May 10, 1919, race riots erupted in <a href=\"/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina\" title=\"Charleston, South Carolina\">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Sylvester,_Georgia\" title=\"Sylvester, Georgia\">Sylvester, Georgia</a>, and over the next five months over 30 race riots occurred across the United States, with nearly one third afflicting Southern cities.

The one-day riot claimed the lives of seven people (six Black), injured hundreds, caused widespread property damage, and led to a permanent exodus of nearly 1,500 Black Knoxville residents.

With the path toward regional accreditation effectively blocked, McKenzie pursued other options to demonstrate Fisk\u2019s academic quality was consistent with White colleges and universities. McKenzie sought to create academic programs  at Fisk that rivaled those at any White college in the United States. During McKenzie\u2019s in first three years at Fisk, he added several new academic departments, including journalism, Spanish, and applied economics, which consisted of courses in accounting, banking, business law, and insurance. He also enlarged and strengthened several existing departments, including English, political science, religion and instituted a system of majors. The study of Black education provided a respected, third-party endorsement of Fisk\u2019s operations. which was instrumental in directing resources toward the University. Attracting quality faculty to Fisk was difficult, and teaching salaries were embarrassingly low. McKenzie\u2019s efforts to increase faculty salaries and secure a pension plan for retirees dramatically improved Fisk\u2019s faculty.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nicholson.2C_p.242-243_55-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nicholson.2C_p.242-243-55\"><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup> In April 1921, McKenzie's formal application for associate status with the <a href=\"/wiki/Carnegie_Foundation_for_the_Advancement_of_Teaching\" title=\"Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching\">Carnegie Foundation</a> was granted by Chairman <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_S._Pritchett\" title=\"Henry S.

The religious piety that had long served as a basis for personal and social customs gave way to motivations for pleasure, wealth, and the nouveau. Emerging technologies such as the automobile, motion pictures, and musical recordings combined with bold new expressions in women\u2019s fashion and behavior that seeded growing antagonism toward outdated and overly conservative aspects of life.

Grinnell asserted that the Indian \u201cmind does not work like the mind of the adult white man.\u201d The difference was not a reflection of intellect, but rather of environment. Grinnell suggested that if a \u201cyoung Indian is separated from his tribe and is brought up in association with white people, and so has an opportunity to have his mind trained to civilized modes of thinking and to imbibe civilized ideas, he is found to be not less intelligent than the average white.\u201d  According to Grinnell, \u201cthe difference in mind means merely that the Indian, like every other human being, receives his knowledge or his mental training from his surroundings.\u201d  Nicholson, p.27-28.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Nicholson.2C_p.16-9\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Nicholson.2C_p.16_9-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Nicholson.2C_p.16_9-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Nicholson, p.16.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-10\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-10\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Hazel W.
