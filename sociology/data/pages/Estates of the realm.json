Commoners were universally considered the lowest order. The higher estates' necessary dependency on the commoners' production, however, often further divided the otherwise equal common people into <a href=\"/wiki/Bourgeoisie\" title=\"Bourgeoisie\">burghers</a> (also known as <a href=\"/wiki/Bourgeoisie\" title=\"Bourgeoisie\">bourgeoisie</a>) of the realm's cities and towns, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Peasant\" title=\"Peasant\">peasants</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Serfdom\" title=\"Serfdom\">serfs</a> of the realm's surrounding lands and villages.

Monarchs often sought to legitimize their power by requiring oaths of fealty from the estates. Today, in most countries, the estates have lost all their legal privileges, and are mainly of historical interest. The nobility may be an exception, for instance due to legislation against <a href=\"/wiki/False_titles_of_nobility\" title=\"False titles of nobility\">false titles of nobility</a>; similarly British government well maintains the distinction- witness its House of Lords, and the House of Commons.\n</p><p>One of the earliest political pamphlets to address these ideas was called \"<a href=\"/wiki/What_Is_the_Third_Estate%3F\" title=\"What Is the Third Estate?\">What Is the Third Estate?</a>\" (French: Qu'est-ce que le tiers-\u00e9tat?)

However the <a href=\"/wiki/Diet_of_Finland\" title=\"Diet of Finland\">Diet of Finland</a> and its four estates was not convened until 1863.\n</p><p>There was also a population outside the estates. Unlike in other areas, people had no \"default\" estate, and were not peasants unless they came from a land-owner's family. A summary of this division is:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Nobility (see <a href=\"/wiki/Finnish_nobility\" title=\"Finnish nobility\">Finnish nobility</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Swedish_nobility\" title=\"Swedish nobility\">Swedish nobility</a>) was exempt from tax, had an inherited <a href=\"/wiki/Ranks_of_nobility_and_peerage\" title=\"Ranks of nobility and peerage\" class=\"mw-redirect\">rank</a> and the right to keep a <a href=\"/wiki/Fief\" title=\"Fief\">fief</a>, and had a tradition of military service and government. Nobility was codified in 1280 with the Swedish king granting exemption from taxation (<i>fr\u00e4lse</i>) to land-owners that could equip a cavalryman (or be one themselves) for the king's army. Around 1400, <a href=\"/wiki/Letters_patent\" title=\"Letters patent\">letters patent</a> were introduced, in 1561 the ranks of <a href=\"/wiki/Count\" title=\"Count\">Count</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Friherre\" title=\"Friherre\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Baron</a> were added, and in 1625 the House of Nobility was codified as the First Estate of the land. Following <a href=\"/wiki/Axel_Oxenstierna\" title=\"Axel Oxenstierna\">Axel Oxenstierna</a>'s reform, higher government offices were open only to nobles. However, the nobility still owned only their own property, not the peasants or their land <a href=\"/wiki/Serfdom\" title=\"Serfdom\">as in much of Europe</a>. Heads of the noble houses were hereditary members of the assembly of nobles. The Nobility is divided into <a href=\"/wiki/Titled_nobility\" title=\"Titled nobility\" class=\"mw-redirect\">titled nobility</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Count\" title=\"Count\">counts</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Baron\" title=\"Baron\">barons</a>) and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Lower_nobility&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Lower nobility (page does not exist)\">lower nobility</a>. Until the 18th century the lower nobility was in turn was divided into <a href=\"/wiki/Knight\" title=\"Knight\">Knights</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Esquire\" title=\"Esquire\">Esquires</a> such that each of the three classes would first vote internally, giving one vote per class in the assembly. This resulted in great political influence for the higher nobility.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Clergy, or priests, were exempt from tax, and collected <a href=\"/wiki/Tithe\" title=\"Tithe\">tithes</a> for the church. After the <a href=\"/wiki/Swedish_Reformation\" title=\"Swedish Reformation\">Swedish Reformation</a>, the church became <a href=\"/wiki/Lutheran\" title=\"Lutheran\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Lutheran</a>. In later centuries, the estate included teachers of universities and certain state schools. The estate was governed by the <a href=\"/wiki/State_church\" title=\"State church\" class=\"mw-redirect\">state church</a> which consecrated its ministers and appointed them to positions with a vote in choosing diet representatives.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Burghers are city-dwellers, tradesmen and craftsmen. Trade was allowed only in the cities when the <a href=\"/wiki/Mercantilism\" title=\"Mercantilism\">mercantilistic</a> ideology had got the upper hand, and the burghers had the exclusive right to conduct commerce within the framework of <a href=\"/wiki/Guild\" title=\"Guild\">guilds</a>. Entry to this Estate is controlled by the autonomy of the towns themselves. Peasants were allowed to sell their produce within the city limits, but any further trade, particularly foreign trade, was allowed only for burghers. In order for a settlement to become a city, a royal charter granting <a href=\"/wiki/Market_right\" title=\"Market right\" class=\"mw-redirect\">market right</a> was required, and foreign trade required royally chartered <a href=\"/wiki/Staple_port\" title=\"Staple port\" class=\"mw-redirect\">staple port</a> rights. After the annexation of Finland into Imperial Russia in 1809, mill-owners and other proto-industrialists would gradually be included in this estate.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Peasants are land-owners of land-taxed farms and their families, which represented the majority in medieval times. Since most of the population were independent farmer families until the 19th century, not serfs nor villeins, there is a remarkable difference in tradition compared to other European countries. Entry was controlled by ownership of farmland, which was not generally for sale but a hereditary property. After 1809, tenants renting a large enough farm (ten times larger than what was required of peasants owning their own farm) were included as well as non-nobility owning tax-exempt land.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>To no estate belonged propertyless <a href=\"/wiki/Serfdom#Bordars_and_cottagers\" title=\"Serfdom\">cottagers</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Villein\" title=\"Villein\" class=\"mw-redirect\">villeins</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tenant_farmer\" title=\"Tenant farmer\">tenants</a> of farms owned by others, farmhands, servants, some lower administrative workers, rural craftsmen, travelling salesmen, vagrants, and propertyless and unemployed people (who sometimes lived in strangers' houses). To reflect how the people belonging to the estates saw them, the Finnish word for \"obscene\", <i>s\u00e4\u00e4dyt\u00f6n</i>, has the literal meaning \"estateless\".</li></ul>\n<p>In Sweden, the Riksdag of the Estates existed until it was replaced with a bicameral Riksdag in 1866, which gave political rights to anyone with a certain income or property. Nevertheless, many of the leading politicians of the 19th century continued to be drawn from the old estates, in that they were either noblemen themselves, or represented agricultural and urban interests. Ennoblements continued even after the estates had lost their political importance, with the last <a href=\"/wiki/Ennoblement\" title=\"Ennoblement\">ennoblement</a> of explorer <a href=\"/wiki/Sven_Hedin\" title=\"Sven Hedin\">Sven Hedin</a> taking place in 1902; this practice was formally abolished with the adoption of the new <a href=\"/wiki/Constitution_of_Sweden\" title=\"Constitution of Sweden\">Constitution</a> January 1, 1975, while the status of the <a href=\"/wiki/Swedish_House_of_Nobility\" title=\"Swedish House of Nobility\" class=\"mw-redirect\">House of Nobility</a> continued to be regulated in law until 2003.\n</p><p>In Finland, this legal division existed until 1906, still drawing on the Swedish constitution of 1772. However, at the start of the 20th century most of the population did not belong to any Estate and had no political representation. A particularly large class were the rent farmers, who did not own the land they cultivated but had to work in the land-owner's farm to pay their rent (unlike Russia, there were no slaves or <a href=\"/wiki/Serf\" title=\"Serf\" class=\"mw-redirect\">serfs</a>.) Furthermore, the industrial workers living in the city were not represented by the four-estate system. The political system was reformed, and the last <a href=\"/wiki/Finnish_general_strike_of_1905\" title=\"Finnish general strike of 1905\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Diet was dissolved</a> in 1905, to create the <a href=\"/wiki/Eduskunta\" title=\"Eduskunta\" class=\"mw-redirect\">modern parliamentary system</a>, ending the political privileges of the estates. The post-independence constitution of 1919 forbade ennoblement, and all tax privileges were abolished in 1920.
