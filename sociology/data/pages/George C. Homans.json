Homans was born in Boston on August 11, 1910, and he perished of a heart ailment on May 29, 1989 in Cambridge, MA; when he died he left behind his wife and his three children as well as four grandchildren.<sup id=\"cite_ref-George_Homans_1989_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-George_Homans_1989-1\"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>  Son of Robert &amp; Abigail (Adams) Homans, he was the great-great grandson of <a href=\"/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams\" title=\"John Quincy Adams\">John Quincy Adams</a>, the 6th President of the United States, and great-great-great grandson of <a href=\"/wiki/John_Adams\" title=\"John Adams\">John Adams</a>, the 2nd President of the United States.  From his <a href=\"/wiki/Autobiography\" title=\"Autobiography\">autobiography</a> (Homans 1984), it is learned that Homans entered <a href=\"/wiki/Harvard_College\" title=\"Harvard College\">Harvard College</a> in 1928 with an area of concentration in <a href=\"/wiki/English_Literature\" title=\"English Literature\" class=\"mw-redirect\">English</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/American_literature\" title=\"American literature\">American literature</a>. By living in an environment where people are highly conscious of social relations, Homans became interested in Sociology. From 1934 to 1939 he was a <a href=\"/wiki/Junior_Fellow\" title=\"Junior Fellow\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Junior Fellow</a> of the newly formed Society of Fellows at Harvard, undertaking a variety of studies in various areas, including <a href=\"/wiki/Sociology\" title=\"Sociology\">sociology</a>, psychology, and history. Homans was taken into the graduate program at Harvard and Pitirim Sorokin who founded the Sociology department in 1930 was credited with bringing in George Homans and Robert Merton into their graduate program.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> An important influence on Homans's perspective was <a href=\"/wiki/Lawrence_Joseph_Henderson\" title=\"Lawrence Joseph Henderson\">Lawrence Joseph Henderson</a>, a biochemist and sociologist who believed that all sciences should be based on a unified set of theoretical and methodological principles. Homans, with no job and nothing to do, attended Henderson's seminar at Harvard one day and was immediately taken by his lecture. As a result, Homans joined a discussion group at Harvard called the Pareto Circle, which was led by Henderson and inspired by the work of <a href=\"/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto\" title=\"Vilfredo Pareto\">Vilfredo Pareto</a>. Henderson often discussed Vilfredo Pareto in his lectures. Pareto was a sociologist who was concerned with economic distribution. Pareto's theories and Henderson's lectures influenced Homans's first book, co-authored with fellow Circle member Charles P. Curtis, called <i>An Introduction to Pareto</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1939 he became a Harvard <a href=\"/wiki/Faculty_(teaching_staff)\" title=\"Faculty (teaching staff)\" class=\"mw-redirect\">faculty</a> member, a lifelong affiliation in which he taught both sociology and <a href=\"/wiki/Medieval_history\" title=\"Medieval history\" class=\"mw-redirect\">medieval history</a> 'as well as studied poetry and small groups.'<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> This teaching brought him in contact with new works in industrial sociology and was exposed to works of functional anthropologists. He was an instructor of Sociology until 1941 when he left to serve the U.S. Navy to support the war. After four years away, he came back to Boston and continued his teaching as an associate professor from 1946 to 1953, and a professor of Sociology after 1953. He was then a visiting professor at the University of Manchester in 1953, at Cambridge University from 1955 to 1956, and at the University of Kent in 1967.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Trevi.C3.B1o.2C_A._Javier_2009_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Trevi.C3.B1o.2C_A._Javier_2009-5\"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> By virtue of his later theoretical writings (discussed below), he was elected President of the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Sociological_Association\" title=\"American Sociological Association\">American Sociological Association</a> in 1964.

His approach to theory developed in two phases, usually interpreted by commentators as <a href=\"/wiki/Inductive_reasoning\" title=\"Inductive reasoning\">inductive</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Deductive\" title=\"Deductive\" class=\"mw-redirect\">deductive</a>, respectively. Although this is a bit of an oversimplification, it provides a framework for outlining his theoretical contributions.\n</p><p>In its mature (1974) form, Homans's theory rests upon two metatheoretical claims, namely, (1) the basic principles of social science must be true of individuals as members of the human species, not as members of particular groups or cultures; and (2) any other generalizations or facts about human social life will be derivable from these principles (and suitable initial conditions). He argued that large-scale structures can be understood if we understand elementary social behavior.<sup id=\"cite_ref-George_Ritzer_2008_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-George_Ritzer_2008-6\"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Another way to grasp his argument is to interpret it as striving to explain spontaneous social order, a point developed in detail by Fararo (2001). Homans's approach is an example of <a href=\"/wiki/Methodology\" title=\"Methodology\">methodological</a> individualism in social science, also favored by some more recent influential social theorists, particularly those who have adopted some form of rational choice theory (e.g., <a href=\"/wiki/James_Samuel_Coleman\" title=\"James Samuel Coleman\">James S. Coleman</a>) that enables greater deductive fertility in theorizing\u2014albeit often with a cost in terms of some loss of <a href=\"//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/realism\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikt:realism\">realism</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Human_Group\">The Human Group</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=George_C._Homans&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The Human Group\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Homans was impressed by Henderson's notion of conceptual scheme. A conceptual scheme consists of a classification of variables (or concepts) that need to be taken into account when studying a set of phenomena.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Trevi.C3.B1o.2C_A._Javier_2009_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Trevi.C3.B1o.2C_A._Javier_2009-5\"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> It also consists of a sketch of the given conditions within which the phenomena are to be analyzed. It also must contain a statement that the variables are related to one another\u2014and following Pareto, that relationship is usually seen as one of mutual dependence.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Trevi.C3.B1o.2C_A._Javier_2009_5-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Trevi.C3.B1o.2C_A._Javier_2009-5\"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Homans was very interested in his conceptual scheme as a way of classifying phenomena and applied it to his own study of small groups. His teachings was included in Homans's work <i>The Human Group</i> (1950). This book's ultimate goal was to move from a study of the social system as it is exemplified in single groups toward a study of the system as it is exemplified in many groups, including groups changing in time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Trevi.C3.B1o.2C_A._Javier_2009_5-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Trevi.C3.B1o.2C_A._Javier_2009-5\"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Homans said \u201cIf we wanted to establish the reality of a social system as a complex of mutually dependent elements, why not begin by studying a system small enough so that we could, so to speak, see all the way around it, small enough so that all the relevant observations could be made in detail and at first hand?\u201d He fulfilled this study throughout his book <i>The Human Group</i>. This book allowed him to make certain generalizations, including the idea that the more frequently people interact with one another, when no one individually initiates interactions more than others, the greater is their liking for one another and their feeling of ease in one another's presence. Although this wasn't Homans's greatest piece of work,<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2009)\">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> it allowed him to become more familiar with this type of methodology and led him towards explaining elementary social behavior.\n</p><p>He also proposes that social reality should be described at three levels: <a href=\"/wiki/Social_event\" title=\"Social event\" class=\"mw-redirect\">social events</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Norm_(social)\" title=\"Norm (social)\">customs</a>, and analytical <a href=\"/wiki/Hypothesis\" title=\"Hypothesis\">hypotheses</a> that describe the processes by which customs arise and are maintained or changed. Hypotheses are formulated in terms of relationships among variables such as frequency of interaction, similarity of activities, intensity of sentiment, and conformity to norms. Using notable sociological and <a href=\"/wiki/Anthropology\" title=\"Anthropology\">anthropological</a> field studies as the grounding for such general ideas, the book makes a persuasive case for <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Treating_group&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Treating group (page does not exist)\">treating groups</a> as social systems that can be analyzed in terms of a verbal <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Analog_(English)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Analog (English) (page does not exist)\">analogue</a> of the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_method&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Mathematical method (page does not exist)\">mathematical method</a> of studying equilibrium and <a href=\"/wiki/Stability_theory\" title=\"Stability theory\">stability</a> of systems.

According to Homans they are psychological for two reasons: first, they are usually tested on people who call themselves psychologists and second, they are psychological because of the level at which they deal with the individual in society. Homans says, \"they are propositions about the behavior of individual human beings, rather than propositions about groups or societies.\" He believed that a sociology built on his principles would be able to explain all social behavior.  Homans also went to say, \"An incidental advantage of an exchange theory is that it might bring sociology closer to economics (Homans 1958:598). But, he regrets that his theory was labeled \"Exchange Theory\" because he sees this social behavior theory as a behavioral psychology applied to specific situations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-George_Ritzer_2008_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-George_Ritzer_2008-6\"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Homans looked to \u00c9mile Durkheim's work for guidance as well, but often disagreed in the end with particular components of Durkheim's theories. For example, Durkheim believed that although individuals are clearly the component parts of society, society is more than the individuals who constitute it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-James_Farganis_2008_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-James_Farganis_2008-7\"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> He believed that society could be studied without reducing it to individuals and their motivations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-James_Farganis_2008_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-James_Farganis_2008-7\"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> However, Homans, through his Exchange Theory, believed that individual beings and behavior are relevant to understanding society.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Albert_Chavannes_and_The_Exchange_Theory\">Albert Chavannes and The Exchange Theory</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=George_C._Homans&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Albert Chavannes and The Exchange Theory\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Although George Homans contributed greatly to the Exchange Theory and his work on it is greatly admired, he was not the very first person to study this theory.  \"From 1883 to 1885 Albert Chivannes published in <i>The Sociologist</i>a series of papers titled 'Studies in Sociology' which treated 'The Law of Exchange' and three other social laws.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>  Chavannes' work on the theory was similar to what Homans did, however he did focus more on empirical sociology, and he did not contribute to it the way in which Homans had done (Knox 1963: 341).  So, although Homans may have not have been the first to work on this theory, how contributions towards it are what make the Exchange Theory what it is today.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_behavior\">Social behavior</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=George_C._Homans&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Social behavior\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Homans's next major work was called <i>Social Behavior: Its Elementary Forms</i>. He wrote this book in 1961 and revised it in 1974. This was based on the principles of behavioral psychology, and helped explain the \"sub-institutional\", or elementary forms of social behavior in small groups.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Trevi.C3.B1o.2C_A._Javier_2009_5-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Trevi.C3.B1o.2C_A._Javier_2009-5\"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> This explanation of social behavior first appeared in an article Homans published titled \"Social Behaviour as Exchange\" in 1958. He believed his Exchange Theory is derived from both behavioral psychology and elementary economics.<sup id=\"cite_ref-George_Ritzer_2008_6-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-George_Ritzer_2008-6\"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Homans had come to the view that theory should be expressed as a <a href=\"/wiki/Deductive_system\" title=\"Deductive system\" class=\"mw-redirect\">deductive system</a>, in this respect falling under the influence of the logical empiricist philosophers of that period. Substantively, he argued that a satisfactory explanation in the social sciences to be based upon \"propositions\"\u2014principles\u2014about individual behavior that are drawn from the behavioral psychology of the time. Homans doesn't believe that new propositions are needed to explain social behavior. The laws of individual behavior developed by Skinner in his study of pigeons explain social behavior as long as we take into account the complications of mutual reinforcement.<sup id=\"cite_ref-George_Ritzer_2008_6-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-George_Ritzer_2008-6\"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> \n</p><p>\"Social Behavior is an exchange of goods, material goods, but also non-material ones, such as the symbols of approval or prestige.  Persons that give much to others try to get much from them, and persons that get much from others try to get much from others are under pressure to give much to them (Homans 1958:606). Social behavior as exchange means that a plurality of individuals, each postulated to behave according to the stated behavioral principles, form a system of interaction.  <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Social_approval&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Social approval (page does not exist)\">Social approval</a> is the basic reward that people can give to one another. In much greater detail, he developed this approach in his book <i>Social Behavior: Its Elementary Forms</i> (1961, revised 1974). Homans exemplifies this type of social behavior below:\n</p><p>\"Suppose that two men are doing paperwork jobs in an office. According to the office rules, each should do his job by himself, or, if he needs help, he should consult the supervisor. One of the men, whom we shall call Person, is not skillful at the work and would get it done better and faster if he got help from time to time. In spite of the rules he is reluctant to go to the supervisor, for to confess his incompetence might hurt his chances for promotion. Instead he seeks out the other man, whom we shall call Other for short, and asks him for help.

The impact he had on his students and colleagues and people he came in contact with can be seen in <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_Tilly\" title=\"Charles Tilly\">Charles Tilly</a>'s work, \"George Caspar Homans and the Rest of Us\".  Some of the quotes mention what he meant to the people who knew and learned from him.  \"His students inherited distrust of theory for its own sake and theories about theories. Even when they disagreed, his students and readers came away stimulated and refreshed.  George was a vivifier, a life- giver\" (Tilly, 1990:264).  Also, he was elected the president of the American Sociological Association in 1964 which allowed him to have a much greater impact on Sociology.  Another praise towards Homans was, \"His differences made a difference to us, his colleagues, his friends, and successors.  George was not, it is true, above rejoicing in his own talents, and thereby shaming or intimidating those about him\" (Tilly, 1990:266).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cited_works_by_Homans\">Cited works by Homans</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=George_C._Homans&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Cited works by Homans\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><i>English Villagers of the Thirteenth Century </i> (1941)</li>\n<li><i>The Human Group</i> (1950)</li>\n<li>\"Social Behavior as Exchange.\" <i>American Journal of Sociology</i> 63:597-606.
