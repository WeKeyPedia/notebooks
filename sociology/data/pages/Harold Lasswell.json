He was a PhD student at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Chicago\" title=\"University of Chicago\">University of Chicago</a>, and he was a professor of law at <a href=\"/wiki/Yale_University\" title=\"Yale University\">Yale University</a>. He served as president both of the <a href=\"/wiki/American_Political_Science_Association\" title=\"American Political Science Association\">American Political Science Association</a> (APSA) and of the <a href=\"/wiki/World_Academy_of_Art_and_Science\" title=\"World Academy of Art and Science\">World Academy of Art and Science</a> (WAAS).\n</p><p>According to a biographical memorial written by <a href=\"/wiki/Gabriel_Almond\" title=\"Gabriel Almond\">Gabriel Almond</a> at the time of Lasswell's death and published by the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Academies_of_Sciences\" title=\"National Academies of Sciences\" class=\"mw-redirect\">National Academies of Sciences</a> in 1987, Lasswell \"ranked among the half dozen creative innovators in the social sciences in the twentieth century.\" At the time, Almond asserted that \"few would question that he was the most original and productive political scientist of his time.\" Areas of research in which Lasswell worked included the importance of <a href=\"/wiki/Personality\" title=\"Personality\">personality</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Social_structure\" title=\"Social structure\">social structure</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Culture\" title=\"Culture\">culture</a> in the explanation of political phenomena. He was noted to be ahead of his time in employing a variety of methodological approaches that later became standards across a variety of intellectual traditions, including interviewing techniques, content analysis, para-experimental techniques, and statistical measurement.\n</p><p>Harold Lasswell, a political scientist by training, was a multidisciplinary academic. He could not pigeonhole his work into a single discipline, but instead celebrated the multi-faceted nature of his products. Lasswell was well associated with the disciplines of political science, psychology, and sociology \u2013 however he did not adhere to the distinction between these boundaries but instead erased the lines drawn to divide these disciplines. <sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Work\">Work</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Harold_Lasswell&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Work\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Lasswell is well known for <a href=\"/wiki/Lasswell%27s_model_of_communication\" title=\"Lasswell's model of communication\">his model of communication</a>, which focuses on \"Who (says) What (to) Whom (in) What Channel (with) What Effect\".\n</p><p>He is also known for his book on aberrant psychological attributes of leaders in politics and business, <i>Psychopathology and Politics</i>, as well as for another book on politics, <i>Politics: Who Gets What, When, and How</i>.\n</p><p>He published his first formula in 1948.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

However, more influential on him was <a href=\"/wiki/Freud\" title=\"Freud\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Freudian</a> philosophy, which informed much of his analysis of <a href=\"/wiki/Propaganda\" title=\"Propaganda\">propaganda</a> and communication in general. During World War II, Lasswell held the position of Chief of the Experimental Division for the Study of War Time Communications at the <a href=\"/wiki/Library_of_Congress\" title=\"Library of Congress\">Library of Congress</a>. He analyzed <a href=\"/wiki/Nazi_propaganda\" title=\"Nazi propaganda\">Nazi propaganda</a> films to identify mechanisms of persuasion used to secure the acquiescence and support of the German populace for Hitler and his wartime atrocities. Always forward-looking, late in his life, Lasswell experimented with questions concerning <a href=\"/wiki/Astropolitics\" title=\"Astropolitics\">astropolitics</a>, the political consequences of colonization of other planets, and the \"machinehood of humanity\".\n</p><p>In his presidential address to the American Political Science Association, he raised the famous question, demanded by the expulsion of essences from the sciences,<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Similarly, his definition of propaganda was also viewed as an important development to understanding the goal of propaganda. Laswell's studies on propaganda produced breakthroughs on the subject which broadened current views on the means and stated objectives that could be achieved through propaganda to include not only the change of opinions but also change in actions. He inspired<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> the definition given by the <a href=\"/wiki/Institute_for_Propaganda_Analysis\" title=\"Institute for Propaganda Analysis\">Institute for Propaganda Analysis</a>: \"Propaganda is the expression of opinions or actions carried out deliberately by individuals or groups with a view to influence the opinions or actions of other individuals or groups for predetermined ends through psychological manipulations.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>\n</p><p>Lasswell utilized Sigmund Freud\u2019s methodology. Lasswell, upon studying with Theodor Reik \u2013 a devotee of Freud \u2013 in Vienna and Berlin, Lasswell was able to appropriate Freud\u2019s methods. <sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Lasswell built a laboratory in his social science office.

The benefit of this contribution is that he was able to engage in another method of research \u2013 content analysis. By being able to use preexisting data, he was in a position to show that his work was not purely positivist but also stepped into the realm of interpretivist as well \u2013 helping him to come together in studies of personality and culture in tandem with his political behavior research.  \n</p><p>Content analysis is the \u201cinvestigation of communication messages by categorizes message content into classifications in order to measure certain variables\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>\nWhile the data existed to Lasswell in the form of analyzing the messages that Allied and Axis armies disseminated within warfare, it may not have been the most accurate of methodologies for analyzing the data. \u201cContent analysts usually seeks to infer the effects of the messages that they have analyzed, although actual data about such communication effects are seldom available to the content analyst\u201d <sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>  While Lasswell was able to perform this particular type of analysis, the weakness to this was that Lasswell could not verify his data due to communication effects not actually being available. This is because content analysis cannot study effects.  While this was a weakness, he did develop content analysis as a communication tool that is still utilized today <sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-1\"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Leo_Rosten\" title=\"Leo Rosten\">Leo Rosten</a> included an appreciation of him in \"People I have loved, known or admired\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contributions\">Contributions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Harold_Lasswell&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Contributions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Lasswell made these contributions to the field of communication study:<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li>His five-questions model of communication led to the emphasis in communication study on determining effects. Lasswell\u2019s contemporary, Paul F. Lazarsfeld, did even more to crystallize this focus on communication effects.</li>\n<li>He pioneered in content analysis methods, virtually inventing the methodology of qualitative and quantitative measurement of communication messages (propaganda messages and newspaper editorials, for example).</li>\n<li>His study of political and wartime propaganda represented an important early type of communication study. The word propaganda later gained a negative connotation and is not used much today, although there is even more political propaganda. Propaganda analysis has been absorbed into the general body of communication research.</li>\n<li>He introduced Freudian psychoanalytic theory to the social sciences in America. Lasswell integrated Freudian theory with political analysis, as in his psychoanalytic study of political leaders. He applied Freud's id-ego-superego via content analysis to political science problems. In essence, he utilized intraindividual Freudian theory at the societal level.</li>\n<li>He helped create the policy sciences, an interdisciplinary movement to integrate social science knowledge with public action.
