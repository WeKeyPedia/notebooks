The term \"space\" has been defined variously by scholars:\n</p><p>In general terms,the Oxford English Dictionary defines space in two ways;\n</p><p>1. A continuous extension viewed with or without reference to the existence of objects within it.  \n2. The interval between points or objects viewed as having one, two or three dimensions.\n</p><p>However, the human geographers\u2019 interest is in the objects within the space and their relative position, which involves the description, explanation and prediction of the distribution of phenomena. Thus, the relationships between objects in space is the central of the study.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Michel_Foucault\" title=\"Michel Foucault\">Michel Foucault</a> defines space as;\n\u201cThe space in which we live, which draws us out of ourselves, in which the erosion of our lives, our time and our history occurs, the space that claws and gnaws at us, is also, in itself, a heterogeneous space\u2026..we live inside a set of relations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Nigel_Thrift\" title=\"Nigel Thrift\">Nigel Thrift</a> also defines space as;\n\"The outcome of a series of highly problematic temporary settlements that divide and connect things up into different kinds of collectives which are slowly provided with the meaning which render them durable and sustainable.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>\n</p><p>In short, \"space\" is the social space in which we live and create relationship with other people, societies and surroundings. Space is an outcome of the hard and continuous work of building up and maintaining collectives by bringing different things into alignments. All kinds of different spaces can and therefore do exist which may or may not relate to each other. Thus, through space, we can understand more about social action.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History_of_the_sociology_of_space\">History of the sociology of space</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sociology_of_space&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History of the sociology of space\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Georg_Simmel\" title=\"Georg Simmel\">Georg Simmel</a> has been seen as the classical sociologist who was most important to this field.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Simmel wrote on \"the sociology of space\" in his 1908 book \"Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation\".

Only in the late 1980s did it come to be realised that certain changes in society cannot be adequately explained without taking greater account of the spatial components of life. This shift in perspective is referred to as the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Topological_turn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Topological turn (page does not exist)\">topological turn</a>. The space concept directs attention to organisational forms of juxtaposition. The focus is on differences between places and their mutual influence. This applies equally for the micro-spaces of everyday life and the macro-spaces at the nation-state or global levels.\n</p><p>The theoretical basis for the growing interest of the social sciences in space was set primarily by English and French-speaking sociologists, philosophers, and human geographers. Of particular importance is <a href=\"/wiki/Michel_Foucault\" title=\"Michel Foucault\"> Michel Foucault\u2019s</a> essay on \u201cOf Other Spaces\u201d,<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> in which the author proclaims the \u201cage of space\u201d, and <a href=\"/wiki/Henri_Lefebvre\" title=\"Henri Lefebvre\"> Henri Lefebvre\u2019s</a> seminal work \u201cLa production de l\u2019espace\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The latter provided the grounding for Marxist spatial theory on which <a href=\"/wiki/David_Harvey_(geographer)\" title=\"David Harvey (geographer)\" class=\"mw-redirect\">David Harvey</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Manuel_Castells\" title=\"Manuel Castells\">Manuel Castells</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Edward_Soja\" title=\"Edward Soja\">Edward Soja</a>, and others have built. Marxist theories of space, which are predicated on a structural, i.e., capitalist or global determinants of spaces and the growing homogenization of space, are confronted by action theoretical conceptions, which stress the importance of the corporeal placing and the perception of spaces as albeit habitually predetermined but subjective constructions. One example is the theory of space of the German sociologist <a href=\"/wiki/Martina_L%C3%B6w\" title=\"Martina L\u00f6w\">Martina L\u00f6w</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Approaches deriving from the <a href=\"/wiki/Postcolonialism\" title=\"Postcolonialism\">post-colonialism</a> discourse have attracted greater attention in recent years.

From a social theory point of view, it follows on from the theory of structuration proposed by <a href=\"/wiki/Anthony_Giddens\" title=\"Anthony Giddens\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Anthony Giddens</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> whose concept of the \u201cduality of structure\u201d L\u00f6w extends sociological terms into a \u201cduality of space.\u201d The basic idea is that individuals act as social agents (and constitute spaces in the process), but that their action depends on economic, legal, social, cultural, and, finally, spatial structures. Spaces are hence the outcome of action. At the same time, spaces structure action, that is to say spaces can both constrain and enable action.\n</p><p>With respect to the constitution of space, L\u00f6w distinguishes analytically between two, generally mutually determining factors: \u201cspacing\u201d and \u201csynthesis.\u201d Spacing refers to the act of placing or the state of being placed of social goods and people in places. According to L\u00f6w, however, an ordering created through placings is only effectively constituted as space where the elements that compose it are actively interlinked by people \u2013 in processes of perception, ideation, or recall. L\u00f6w calls this synthesis. This concept has been empirically tested in studies such as those by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Lars_Meier&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Lars Meier (page does not exist)\">Lars Meier</a> (who examined the constitution of space in the everyday life of financial managers in London and Singapore), <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Cedric_Janowicz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Cedric Janowicz (page does not exist)\">Cedric Janowicz</a> (who carried out an ethnographical-space sociological study of food supply in the Ghanaian city of <a href=\"/wiki/Accra\" title=\"Accra\">Accra</a>), and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Silke_Steets&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Silke Steets (page does not exist)\">Silke Steets</a> (who looked at processes of space constitution in the creative industries in Leipzig).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Marxist_approaches\">Marxist approaches</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sociology_of_space&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Marxist approaches\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The most important proponent of Marxist spatial theory was <a href=\"/wiki/Henri_Lefebvre\" title=\"Henri Lefebvre\">Henri Lefebvre</a>.

Lefebvre sees a line of flight from alienated spatiality in the spaces of representation \u2013 in notions of non-alienated, mythical, pre-modern, or artistic visions of space.\n</p><p>Marxist spatial theory was given decisive new impetus by <a href=\"/wiki/David_Harvey_(geographer)\" title=\"David Harvey (geographer)\" class=\"mw-redirect\">David Harvey</a>, in particular, who was interested in the effects of the transition from <a href=\"/wiki/Fordism\" title=\"Fordism\">Fordism</a> to \u201cflexible accumulation\u201d on the experience of space and time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> He shows how various innovations at the economic and technological levels have breached the crisis-prone inflexibility of the Fordist system, thus increasing the turnover rate of capital. This causes a general acceleration of economic cycles. According to Harvey, the result is \u201ctime-space compression.\u201d While the feeling for the long term, for the future, for continuity is lost, the relationship between proximity and distance becomes more and more difficult to determine.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Postcolonial_theories_of_space\">Postcolonial theories of space</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sociology_of_space&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Postcolonial theories of space\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Theories of space that are inspired by the <a href=\"/wiki/Postcolonialism\" title=\"Postcolonialism\">post-colonialism</a> discourse focus on the heterogeneity of spaces.

He claims that local contexts form a sort of framework or filter through which global processes and globally circulating images and symbols are appropriated, thus attaining meaning. For instance, the film character <a href=\"/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian_(1982_film)\" title=\"Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)\">Conan the Barbarian</a> is a different figure in radical rightwing circles in Germany than in the black ghettoes of the Chicago Southside, just as <a href=\"/wiki/McDonald%E2%80%99s\" title=\"McDonald\u2019s\" class=\"mw-redirect\">McDonald\u2019s</a> means something different in Moscow than in Paris.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Third_Space\">Third Space</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sociology_of_space&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Third Space\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/Henri_Lefebvre\" title=\"Henri Lefebvre\">Henri Lefebvre</a> says that (social) space is a (social) product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions.

That means that we need to consider how the various modes of spatial production relate to each other.\n</p><p>He argues that there are three aspects to our spatial existence, which exist in a kind of triad:<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>\n</p><p>1.

Second Space\n(Mental space/conceived space)\n\"Conceptualized space, the space of scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers, as of a certain type of artist with a scientific bent -- all of whom identify what is lived and what is perceived with what is conceived.\"\n</p><p>3. Third Space\n(Social space/lived space)\n\"Space as directly lived through its associated images and symbols.\"\n</p><p>Even though there are many disciplines in the study of Human Geography, the most well-known approach is \u201cThe third space\u201d formulated by <a href=\"/wiki/Edward_Soja\" title=\"Edward Soja\">Edward Soja</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> In unitary theory, there are three approaches; first space, second space and third space. First space is physical space, and spaces are measurable and mappable. The second space is a mental or conceived space which comes from our thinking and ideas. However, the third space is a social space/lived space which is a social product that is a space created by society under oppression or marginalization that want to reclaim the space of inequality and make it into something else. Soja argues that our old ways to thinking about space (first and second space theories) can no longer accommodate the way the world works because he believed that spaces may not be contained within one social category, they may include different aspects of many categories or developed within the boundaries of a numbers of category. For instance, two different cultures combine together and emerge as a third culture. This third hybrid space displaces the original values that constitute it and set up new values and perspectives that is different from the first two spaces. Thus, the third space theory can explain some of the complexity of poverty, social exclusion and social inclusion, gender and race issues.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rational_view_of_space\">Rational view of space</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sociology_of_space&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Rational view of space\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In the work of geographer and critical theorist <a href=\"/wiki/Nigel_Thrift\" title=\"Nigel Thrift\">Nigel Thrift</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> he wrote a rational view of space in which, rather than seeing space being viewed as a container within which the world proceeds, space should be seen as a co-product of these proceedings. He explained about four constructed space in modern human geography. \nThere are four different kinds of space according to how modern geography thinks about space. They are 1. Empirical Construction of Space, 2. Unblocking space, 3. Image space and 4. Place Space.\n</p><p><b>First Space</b> is the empirical construction of space. Empirical space refers to the process whereby the mundane fabric of daily life is constructed. These simple things like, cars, houses, mobiles, computers and roads are very simple but they are great achievements of our daily life and they play very important role in making up who we are today. For example, today\u2019s technology such as GPS did not suddenly come into existence; in fact, it is laid down in the 18th century and developed throughout time. The first space is real and tangible, and it is also known as physical space.\n<b>Second space</b> is the unblocking space. This type of space refers to the process whereby routine pathways of interaction as set up around which boundaries are often drawn. The routine may include the movement of office workers, the interaction of drunk teenagers, and the flow of good, money, people, and information. Unlike the old time in geography when people accepted a space as blocked boundary (Example: A capitalist space, neoliberal space or city space), we began to realize that there is no such thing like boundaries in space. The space of the world is flowing and transforming continuously that it is very difficult to describe in a fixed way. The second space is ideology/conceptual and it is also known as mental space. For example, the second space will explain the behaviors of people from different social class and the social segregation among rich and poor people. \n<b>Third space</b> is the image space that refers to the process whereby the images has produced new kind of space. The images may be in different form and shape; ranging from painting to photograph, from portrait to post card, and from religious theme to entertainment. Nowadays, we are highly influenced by images in many ways and these certain images can tell us new social and cultures values, or something new about how we see the world. Images, symbols and sign do have some kind of spatial expression. \n<b>Fourth space</b> is the place that refers to the process whereby spaces are ordered in ways that open up affective and other embodied potentials. Place space has more meaning than a place and it can represent as different type of space.

As a result, we have seen the creation of <a href=\"/wiki/Supra-national\" title=\"Supra-national\" class=\"mw-redirect\">supra-national</a> political bodies such as the <a href=\"/wiki/European_Union\" title=\"European Union\">European Union</a>, the devolution of political power from the nation-state to regional political bodies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> We have also experienced the increasing homogenization and \u2018<a href=\"/wiki/Americanization\" title=\"Americanization\">Americanization</a>\u2019 through the process of globalization while the locals\u2019 tendencies (or counter force)among people who defend traditional ways of life increase around the world .The process of re-scaling people\u2018s lives and the relationship between the two extremes of our scaled lives- the \u2018global\u2019 and the \u2018local\u2019 were brought into question.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ontological_status_of_the_global_and_the_local\">Ontological status of the global and the local</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sociology_of_space&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Ontological status of the global and the local\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Until the 1980s, theorizing the concept of \u2018scale\u2019 itself was taken for granted although physical and human geographers looked at issues from \u2018regional scale\u2019 or\u2018national scale\u2019. The questions such as whether scale is simply a mental device categorizing and ordering the world or whether scales really exists as material social products, particularly, were debated among <a href=\"/wiki/Materialists\" title=\"Materialists\" class=\"mw-redirect\">materialists</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Idealists\" title=\"Idealists\" class=\"mw-redirect\">idealists</a>. Some geographers draw upon Immanuel Kant\u2019s idealist philosophy that scales were handy conceptual mechanism for ordering the world while others, by drawing upon Marxist ideas of materialism, argue that scales really exist in the world and they were the real social products. For those idealists based on Kantian\u2018s inspiration, the \u2018global\u2019 is defined by the geologically given limits of the earth and the \u2018local\u2019 is defined as a spatial resolution useful for comprehending the process and practices. For materialists, the \u2018national\u2019 scale is a scale that had to be actively created through economic and political processes but not a scale existed in a logical hierarchy between global and the regional.\n</p><p>The notion of \u2018becoming\u2019 and the focus on the politics of producing scales have been central to materialist<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> arguments concerning the global scale. It is important to recognize that social actors may have to work just as hard to become \u2018local\u2019as they have to work to become \u2018global\u2019. People paid attention to how transnational corporations have \u2018gone global\u2019, how institutions of governance have\u2018become\u2019 supra-national and how labour unions have sought to \u2018globalize\u2019 their operations to match those of an increasingly \u2018globalized\u2019 city.\n</p><p>For the scale \u2018global\u2019 and \u2018local\u2019, Kevin Cox mentioned that moving from the local to the global scale \u2018is not a movement from one discrete arena to another\u2019 but a process of developing networks of associations that allow actors to shift between various spaces of engagement. According to his view, \u2018scale\u2019 is seen as a process rather than as a fixed entity and, in other words, the global and the local are not static \u2019arenas\u2019within which social life plays out but are constantly made by social actions.For example, a political organization might attempt to go \u2018global\u2019 to engage with actors or opportunities outside of its own space; likewise, a transnational corporation may attempt to \u2018go local\u2019 through tailoring its products and operations in different places.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Discourses_of_the_global_and_the_local\">Discourses of the global and the local</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sociology_of_space&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Discourses of the global and the local\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/J._K._Gibson-Graham\" title=\"J. K. Gibson-Graham\">Gibson-Graham</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> (2002) has identified at least six ways in which the relationship between the local and the global is often viewed.\n</p><p>1. The global and the local are seen as interpretive frames for analyzing situations\n</p><p>2. Drawing on Dirlik, Gibson-Graham suggests that in such a representation, the global is \u2018something more than the national or regional ..anything other than the local\u2019. Meaning that, the global and the local each derive meaning from what they are not.\n</p><p>3. According to French social theorist <a href=\"/wiki/Bruno_Latour\" title=\"Bruno Latour\">Bruno Latour</a>, the local and the global \u2018offer different points of view on networks that are by nature neither local nor global, but are more or less long and more or less connected. Also, in Latour\u2019s view, it is impossible to distinguish where the local ends and the global begins.\n</p><p>4. The concept \u2018The global is local\u2019 was proposed by Gibson-Graham. For instance, multinational firms are actually \u2018multi local\u2018 rather than \u2018global\u2019.\n</p><p>5. The local is global. In this view,the local is an entry point to the world of global flows which encircle the planet.\n</p><p>6. The global and the local are actually the processes rather than the locations. All spaces are the hybrids of global and local; so they are \u2018glocal.\u2019\n</p><p>There are some western thoughts that greater size and extensiveness imply domination and superior power, such that the local is often represented as \u2018small and relatively powerless, defined and confined by the global\u2019. So, the global is a force and the local is its field of play. However, the local can serve as a powerful scale of political organization; the global is not a scale just controlled by capital \u2013 those who challenge capital can also organize globally( Herod, A). There has been the concept \u2018Think globally and act locally\u2019 viewed by <a href=\"/wiki/Neoliberals\" title=\"Neoliberals\" class=\"mw-redirect\">neoliberals</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Metaphors_of_scale\">Metaphors of scale</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sociology_of_space&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Metaphors of scale\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>For representing how the world is scaled, there are five different and popular metaphors: they are the ladder, concentric circles, Matryoshka nesting dolls,earthworm burrows and tree roots. First, in using such a metaphor of hierarchical ladder, the global as the highest rung on the ladder is seen to be above the local and all other scales. Second, the use of concentric metaphor leaves us with a particular way of conceptualizing the scalar relationship between places. In this second metaphor, the local is seen as a relatively small circle, with the regional as a larger circle encompassing it, while the national and the global scales are still larger circles encompassing the local and the regional. For the hierarchy of Russian Matryoshka nesting dolls, the global can contain other scales but this does not work the other way round; for instance, the local cannot contain the global. For the fourth metaphor concerning with thinking on scale, what French social theorist <a href=\"/wiki/Bruno_Latour\" title=\"Bruno Latour\">Bruno Latour</a> argued is that a world of places is \u2018networked\u2019 together. Such the metaphor leaves us with an image of scale in which the global and the local are connected together and not totally separated from each other.  For the tree roots metaphor similar with the earthworm burrow metaphor, as the earthworm burrows or tree roots penetrating different strata of the soil, it is difficult to determine exactly where one scale ends and another begins. When thinking about the use of metaphor, it should be aware that the choice of metaphor over another is not made on the basis of which is empirically a \u2018more accurate\u2019representation of something but, on the basis of how someone is attempting to understand a particular phenomenon.\n</p><p>Such an appreciation of metaphors is important because it suggests that how we talk about scale impacts upon the ways in which we engage socially and politically with our scaled world and that may impact on how we conduct our social,economic and political praxis and so make landscapes ( Herod,A<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> )\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sociology_of_space&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li> <a href=\"/wiki/Sociology_of_architecture\" title=\"Sociology of architecture\">Sociology of architecture</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"/wiki/Urban_sociology\" title=\"Urban sociology\">Urban sociology</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Sociology_of_space&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><span class=\"citation journal\">Kham, Miriam (March 2000). <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/683535\">\"Tahiti Intertwined: Ancestral Land, Tourist Postcard, and Nuclear Test Site\"</a>. <i>American Anthropologist,</i>.
